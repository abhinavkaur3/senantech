" If you purchase the Land Cruiser for its intended use it cannot be beat. For low maintenance and off road, on road ability it cannot be beat in the long run. It is not intended to be a grocery getter. All are built in Japan and intended to last 300k miles. They are shipped all over the world for tough off road conditions. Enjoy your Cruisers.

No doubt they are huge and ponderous to drive and like any other large SUV are big boxes in the wind that return poor gas mileage. However, for pure reliability and comfort, toyota comes thru. This is a pricey vehicle, no doubt, and you would expect memory seats and a more appointed interior, but a true toyota buyer does his homework thoroughly up front and knows their strength is in the fact that you will own this vehicle for years to come and when you move on, most likely your loyalty will remain with toyota","1"

It goes through brake pads and rotors.  Second set of rotors in 80,000 miles.  Also had the head gasket blow out in Vail, which was extremely expensive.

" Overall generally pleased with this vehicle and hope it is as reliable as everyone says, but...   After driving for a few months I am disappointed in the lack of some basic features one would expect in a $60K luxury SUV.  Very basic and bland vehicle and becoming extremely dated in its offering. I have nicknamed it the dinosaur.","1"

" I purchased the long bodied 8-seater and although this car is no beauty to look at, it is the best car I've ever owned, and most certainly the best of my SUVs.  Because it is a diesel powered car, the fuel consumption is much better than the gas models. It has great stability and efficiently corrects any tendency to sway in speedy curves.  Design is extremely sturdy and strong but heavy acceleration is remarkably good.  Service prices are quite reasonable. Rational design allows for very fast service and time/mileage between required service is highly competitive.","1"

" My family has owned six (6!) Land Cruisers over the years, but I was the black sheep who strayed and purchased a Range Rover.

"There's a reason the UN owns 12,000 Land Cruisers: you can't kill 'em. This vehicle is, by far, the most reliable & able SUV in the world. I am the prodigal son who returned, and the LC is where I'm going to stay.","1"

" We purchased it in the summer of 2005 and have taken it on cross country trip, over endless NYC potholes and off road. It is smooth, refined, has great visibility and extremely comfortable front row seating.  The engine, the shifting and all other mechanical features appear flawless.","1"
"Never had a single problem with it. Nothing.  NB, I looked at Range Rovers (then $25k more) and the LX 470 (then $9k more). Looking now, used car value of the Range Rover is the same as the Land Cruiser and the LX 470 is only $2k more - so the extra cash would have virtually evaporated over time.","1"

I have driven it as a commuter, on long road trips, and even camped in it and it has exceeded expectations in every scenario.  I also love the interior appointments, and the stateliness of the exterior styling, and think of it as everything the Range Rover should be without the constant trips to the shop. With more than 5 years of ownership the only times it has been in the shop have been to repair body damaged caused by my wife's impatience, and routine maintenance.","1"

" Traded In 2004 BMW X5 for first Toyota Landcruiser and could not be happier.  The Landcruiser is much bigger and roomier.  Interior room is spacious and comfortable and build quality is excellent.  Fuel economy is fair, but this is expected with a vehicle of this size and weight.  The Landcruiser rides and handles exceptionally well for a large SUV.  The ride is smooth and comfortable and even more enjoyable on long trips.  The cabin is full of driver amenities and the vehicle is built with quality and Toyota reliability.  The 275 HP engine is smooth and responsive.  Love the Bluetooth capability.  Satellite radio is an option that should come standard for the price of this SUV. The best SUV.","1"

" Picked up the car from the dealership when purchased and the car was making a ear piercing noise coming from the wheels.","3"
"Ended up being the brake shields rubbing the brake rotors.","4"
" The car is not that good looking to begin with, but it comes in any color you want as long as its white, black, 50 shades of grey, or Christmas tree ornament blue or red, very boring.  You get what you pay for, but surprisingly  for the price the fit and finish are very good.. The interior does seem to contain a lot of shiny cheap plastic.  They also put a lot of emphasis on back seat legroom, but they didn't leave any upfront and that makes the car uncomfortable on a long trip.  I have already stopped to stretch my legs so as not to get a DVT.","1"
"My major complaint is the CV transmission.  I'm sure this may be an adequate transmission is a state that is flat, or in a snowmobile; but where I live It is very hilly and there is the problem.   First it is noisy under acceleration and that acceleration is very poor.  It is slower that the 4 speed automatic it replaced and a snail when compared to a manual shift. The engine races when accelerating, and  it seems you are always waiting for the transmission to catch up.  The RPM are all over the place, and passing can take a long time and be dangerous.  Toyota put phony shift points in a transmission that doesn't shift; this is very irritating and it is one more thing to go wrong.  I wonder what Toyota was thinking?  Has anyone asked why the 2018 Camry started with a clean sheet of paper and they didn't put a CVT in that car?  My theory is that this transmission is light duty only.","1"
"Instead of gears there is a belt between two drums, and unlike a gear that meshes, the belts probably need a high coefficient of friction to function and friction  spells wear.  I was going to purchase this car until a friend, who is a transmission technician , suggested I lease it because in about 60k-70k miles there is a good chance of transmission failure. Visits to various websites appears to bear that out.  If the factory has all this confidence with this gum band transmission why don't they offer a longer FACTORY warranty to give the buyer peace of mind? If there are a lot of problems model wide, resale will suffer.  Before you buy one insist on an overnight test drive to see if you can live with it.  Why can't Toyota give us options like a 6 speed auto, 5 speed manual, or a dual clutch auto?","1"
"There really is no alternative except Kia, Hyundai, or Mazda since the Honda civic, Nissan Sentra, and Nissan Altima also have CVTs.  I realize that auto companies are being forced into this with CAFE averages, but I'm not happy with this transmission and a potential of a $4500+ replacement charge, when it is out of warranty, so they can meet the CAFE and be able to sell a Tundra. This is just my opinion, but if you are buying for the long term maybe you should research CVTs on some websites","1"
"Other complaints are lack of road feel, visibility is poor, and one has no idea where the front bumper is (maybe they need an upfront camera too), too much pedal travel in the brake, and difficulty getting in and out","1"
" After doing my research on the 2017 Corolla I bought the XSE with Nav. So far I like the car for what it is drives nice ok power fairly comfortable. So after a week of ownership I needed foglights being told by sale staff that the did have them guess what it dose not. So long story short i'm stuck Toyota needs to pull there heads out and equip these cars correctly no fog lights how much could they cost really.Other than that i'm pretty happy with the car.But I won't but abother Toyota product bad customer service both corp and dealers.","1"
" I have only had this car a little over a day.  I drive 45-60 minutes one way to work everyday.  So a total of 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours a day in my car.  If you do any kind of long distance driving, beware, the seats are extremely uncomfortable.  There is zero support.   Also, hard to get in and out of unless you are young in age and or in great shape.   I wish I would have paid more attention before I leased it.","1"
" Really happy with my new Corolla. I replaced my 10 year-old Matrix with this fully-loaded version. So far I'm more than happy. If it serves me as well as did my Matrix, I couldn't recommend it too highly.","1"
" I have been a Toyota fan since I bought my first one in the 1960's, I haven't owned any other brand and I was never disappointed until 2016. I was extremely happy with my 2004 and never would have given it up(it only had 48,000 mi.) if it wasn't totaled by another driver. At low speeds(30mph) the car hesitates as if I am continually touching the brake. At highway speed (60mph) the car does not hold the road and drifts, so I am constantly steering to hold the car steady. At my six month checkup they told me the car was performing normally and this was backed up by a case manager at Toyota headquarters. I have the temperature set at 66 degrees, but the air always seems too hot or too cold. I am short and I find the visibility poor. I am also over 65 so I am not a fan of having to program everything,but that's my problem, not the car's. Well, that's enough complaining for now. I have gotten used to the car so it's not as bad as when I first got it. One good thing is that the hesitation has stopped, but it took a year.","1"
" First, there is a lot of things right with this car.  Fit and Finish are great, and there are no squeaks or rattles, and the price (with discounts) make it a better deal than a Honda.  If everything else after that was just average I would be satisfied, BUT.  The transmission is horrible.  The CVT works great in snowmobile, but does it belong in a car?  The engine is always revving to a high rpm range when you accelerate, and you wait for the transmission to catch up.  It is dangerous when you try to pass or merge from an on ramp.  This creates a lot of noise in the cabin.  I know now why the salesman went with me on the test drive, picked the route (city streets), and never stopped talking.  It was so I wouldn't notice how bad the noise or tranny was.  I took the car on a 100 mile trip to my parents house and my back hurt and I'm young, skinny, and a runner.  when you take a test drive leave the salesman at the dealer.  If they insist on going along, walk away.  Drive onto a highway, try merging with traffic, try to pass, and you won't buy it. The car is so slow and hesitant that it is almost dangerous.  I am going to trade this car on a Honda or Nissan next year, take the bath, and never look back .   What we need is a law that you can return the car in 48 hours and I bet that a lot of people will.","1"
" My family has enjoyed the use of a 1998 Corolla that was purchased new. For the past eighteen years and more than 235,00 miles, problem free driving was ours with only routine scheduled maintenance. Two weeks ago we decided to purchase a new Corolla. We test drove the 2017 Corolla. The lack of comfort and the level of road noise in "that cabin", as compared to what we had become accustomed to in our 1998 model was no small matter. The noise especially, was so annoying that we decided to purchase a Camry after giving one a test drive that very same day. I had learned from the sales manager that a lot of owners of our generation Corolla had decided to upgrade to a new Camry instead of repeating their purchase of a new Corolla after test driving the new Corolla. The manager also mentioned that Toyota made certain design changes between the model years that probably contributed to the issues we had with the new Corolla.","1"
" I read all the reviews before purchase and I am really happy with this car. It is a great value. The safety features that come standard are awesome. I like the radar-responsive cruise control for highway commuting, as well as the lane alert. The design of the car is such that there are very few blind spots. The seat is very comfortable, and it is just comfortable to drive. The turning radius is great and it is very responsive. I live in a city with hills and I love the hill assist feature--no rolling back! It is also great for city parking. The temperature control and sound system are wonderful. The gas mileage is fantastic! And this is a car which holds its value and comes with years of mainteance support, keeping the mainteance costs lows. The only two areas that could be improved are consistent with what the fancy car reviewers say: 1) it could go from 0 to 60 a little faster. That being said, it is consistent with other value cars that I have driven. No better but no worse. 2) The gear shifts in lower gears are a little louder than they could be. There are quieter cars out there. But overall this is car is a great value! I needed a car at a good price, that would hold its value, had great fuel efficiency, high safety standards and low maintenance costs. This car wins in all those categories. And it is fun to drive. The bonus for us is that the trunk is big enough to take the two kids camping, and the 60/40 split means one person can sit in the back seat and we can still haul longer items. Very pleased!","1"
" Pros: Superb headlights with every even and bright illumination; tight fit and finish, very solid construction; low operating cost.  Cons: If you want to know what it feels like driving a coffin this is it! Very dark claustrophobic interior, poor outward visibility; noisy at speed; poor straight line stability; persistent and irritating understeer. Boring exterior design.  Some very hard and sharp plastic in the wrong spots that really will hurt you.","1"
" We have it for about one month. So far we like it. As a family car it is great. The thing I like most is, the Adaptive cruise control and line departure alert. Also LED lights great when driving in dark","1"
" I purchased a Corolla because of its reliability and good reputation, and I absolutely loved everything about this car at first. Unfortunately, my little dream car turned into a nightmare a mere 3 weeks after purchase. While stopped at a red light, an error message popped up on the dash saying "Charging System Malfunction" and I thought it was just an issue with my GPS, which was plugged into the outlet. I unplugged it and then another message popped up, this time saying "Oil pressure low" followed by messages saying to consult my owners manual and to take the car in for service. I was at an intersection and tried to turn onto the side road, only to find I had no accelerator power. I was slamming on the gas trying to move, and I was only able to do so because I was going downhill. Two good samaritans helped push me to safety, but to my horror I had NO brakes while the car was in neutral. I had to shift the car into park and lurch to a stop. One of the guys who helped suggested turning off and restarting the car, and sure enough the error messages went away. Still, I had it towed to the dealership, after dealing with Toyota Care and waiting 2 hours for the tow truck to get there. To condense this novel, the car threw no error codes when service checked it, and they're maintaining that nothing is wrong with the car. I've had to open a case with Toyota and I honestly can't believe what a horrible experience the whole thing has been. More effort has been put into attacking my credibility and denying what happened than it has in actually fixing what's obviously a major issue. For a brand new car to malfunction and impede my ability to control it is unacceptable, and I will not be driving it again. I really hope I was just sold a lemon and that no other owners experience these issues, but I will NEVER buy a Toyota again. They do not stand behind their products, and I highly recommend taking your business to a manufacturer that does.","1"
" 2013 Corolla LE w/ complete package. Cute, stylish & economical car. Was averaging around 30-34 mpg in town. Full tank gets you 400 miles + . Had steering wheel issue but the problem was fixed by dealership under warranty. Touch screen display not as responsive & had to push it a couple times. Entunes could use some improvement. The sound system is nice. Loved my sunroof. Sometimes it's much nicer to drive a smaller car because you can make quick u turns & fit into smaller parking areas. I really liked this car but it didn't have enough power for me. I didn't feel comfortable merging on to busy freeways/highways. Also space & leg room felt kind of tight. Other than that this is a great car.","1"
"Body Style, Lights, Sunroof, Sound System, Economical. Fun to drive in town.","5"
"More leg room. Entunes touch display needs to be more responsive. More sturdy door handles, the plastic feels cheap & easy to break off. The sideview mirror control needs to be on the door panel not under the driver's side ac vent. A little more power under the hood. The electrical power steering could be more quiet while turning wheel, almost sounds like plastic rubbing on plastic.","1"
" I just bought a 2013 Corolla S loaded. I am still in the high from it. I can tell you that thing is nice! It's not a boring ride at all. I have plenty of power for traffic maneuvering. I love how it has a luxury ride feel and how spaciousness the cabin is. I think it looks very cool and hip...especially at night.","1"
"Not plain like some others say. This thing is sharp on the outside also...very sporty. I really made a wise decision buying this. Not only is it cool and stylish, but it will last many years to come thanks to Toyota's quality.","1"

" Many people pan the Corolla's aging platform saying it has drum brakes etc. Well the Ford Focus has drum brakes and people think it is the best ever. I drove both cars, owned the new Dart and sold it, driven the Chevy Cruise and Noisy Mazda 3. Out of all the cars I did like the new Civic the most, however their price premium at dealer lots is not worth what you get on Civic Vs. Corolla. The new 2014 Corolla doesn't change much from the old and I didn't feel the need to wait for the newer model. The car is quiet, smooth, and build quality compared to the Dart isn't even close. The Focus was small on the inside compared to the Corolla and I would buy another Corolla in the future.","1"
"Touch screen radio ( would like to see XM standard across the board if it is not for 2014). Cruise control which is a must have. And the tinted windows from the factory are nice.","1"
"5-6 Speed auto transmission. Not a big fan of CVT even though the new Corolla except for L has 7 "shift points" it isn't the same as a traditional 5-6 speed unit. The four speed is o.k. but noise on the highway and full consumption would improve with just one or two more gears. Otherwise the 4 speed is reliable and smooth most of the time.","1"

" I bought my Toyota Corolla S 2007 in fall of 2006, and named her Libby. Truth be told, I have had prettier (aesthetically pleasing) cars, but no car has ever matched her reliability. She is now 216,000 miles old and still keeps on keeping on. When I got her, I was single and now 7 years later, we have a 7 year old daughter, 2 big dogs and Libby. My husband's truck is in the shop, and Libby has been our single vehicle off/on since 2008. In 2012-current, I've had a relatively long commute for my job, upwards of 45-60 min one way, so both ways everyday - Lots of driving. Libby is a true workhorse, and we ensure she is has regular maintenance (full synthetic oil changes, etc.). She's never, knock on wood, had any major repair. Right now she needs new shocks/struts (front/back) because we've lived in some very rural areas with lots of pot holes, dips and rough terrain. I'm on this website right now because we're searching for a bigger family vehicle, and will likely give Libby to a family friend while she job searches. I want to say the Toyota Corolla S is outstanding value, reliability and performance. It is not made for fast rides and showing off, but for a solid smaller sedan that excels in endurance and good quality!","1"
" This is an impressive car in all respects. Exterior design is very attractive with the S package but I prefer it without the spoiler. Build quality is outstanding. Love the ride and handling and fuel mileage seems to meet spec--I've had my car for a week. It's quieter on the road than I thought it would be. Seats are comfortable but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the driver cushion is  a little short ( and I have short legs).I also agree with others who complain about needing a telescoping wheel. Horsepower is adequate. Amazing trunk size for a compact. I recently drove a Caliber and it cannot match the Corolla in any category. I'm glad I bought my Corolla.","1"
" Bought this car one month ago.  I love it.  40 mpg overall avg with 25%city/75% hwy after 2000 miles.  Handles well and acceleration with the 5 speed is great.  The drivers seat takes some getting used to, not the most comfortable.  I am 5'll'' and 195lbs and the seat and front leg room are only adequate for my size.  I would not recommend this car to anyone above 6'2'' or 220lbs. The build quality is typically Toyota solid.  My backup car is a 93 Corolla that has 222,000miles on it and still runs great, so I am hoping the reliability will be the same with the 07.  Overall, its a well built car with excellent resale value, is great on gas, and has a history of bulletproof reliability.","1"
"Excellent gas mileage even at 80mph on the hwy.  Indigo ink is a very sharp color.  Stock CD system.  Reliability. 5-spd shifter.","2"
"Telescoping steering wheel, more front leg room, wider seat.  Rear disc brakes would be nice.","2"
" I purchased my 2007 Toyota Corolla LE, 5-speed manual transmission car from a dealer in 2011 after parting ways with my '96 Honda Civic. I love this car. It has great get up and go and is super reliable. When I first got this car, I had a long highway commute each day and I got amazing gas mileage (36 MPG). Two years ago, I moved and my commute is now a 10 minute drive through town and even though my MPG dropped is is still averaging about 33 MPG. Not bad!","1"
"When I purchased the car it had 75,000 miles on it and since then I have nearly doubled that to 135,000 miles. It is still going strong. No issues. No super expensive repairs, just regular maintenance. This car is great! I had planned (and would love) to drive this car until it refuses to go anymore but our family acquired two large dogs so I am forced to seek out a larger vehicle. But I am sad to see my car go! I would buy it again in a heartbeat!","1"
" At first, I was hesitant to buy such a compact car since I have driven nothing but SUV's. I sold my 2003 Suburbam about a month ago because of gas prices but when my brother told me about the Corolla I paid attention. I was looking for economical car anyways and went to test drive it. I was hooked as soon as I drove it.It rides smoothly, it has power and it is fun to drive. The features I got for the price, automatic transmission, power mirrors, CD, outside temperture and AC all for the outrageous price of $11,998.00 is a heck of a deal.","1"
"CD and AC","5"
"power windows standard for the entry model CE.","4"
" I'm 65 years old and this Corolla just makes me like it more each time I drive it. In the city it runs around like a peppy little rabbit and on the highway it handles 75 mph speed limits like you are going 50. Fully loaded with 3 big adults and luggage and coolers (the trunk is larger than you think) cruising at 75 mph our gas mileage was 37 & 38 mpg. Less money and better equipped than all the other vehicles I tested. In a few years I may give this car to my grandson and then I may try a Camry. Anyway, buy one and start to enjoy it right now.","1"
"Gas mileage & performance are great from this peppy 1.8L 4 cylinder. Quality of workmanship throughout the vehicle is vvery high standard.","1"
" We have long been a Ford family however our last Fusion did not meet our expectations due to a lot of mechanical issues and poor fuel economy.","1"
"After test drives of the Ford Focus, Mazda 3 and Mazda 6, the Corolla was by far my favorite and has been a great car, both in performance and build quality.","1"
"So far we've averaged around 33 MPG in mostly city driving conditions which helps a lot with higher fuel prices!","2"
"This car looks great both inside and out and is fun to drive as well.","5"
"I look forward to giving this car to my son in about six years when he gets his license!","2"
" I did my research.","5"
"I test drove several cars that I was reading rave reviews about - the Ford Focus, the Chevy Cruze, the Hyundai Elantra, the Nissan Sentra (which was worth considering, although darn it no telescoping steering wheel) and others that didn't get the rave reviews like the Honda Civic, which was overpriced I thought and not too impressive...","1"
"But I LOVED the Corolla S although you pay more for the S, and then I was almost in Camry territory (and same gas mileage believe it or not) but would have wanted the SE which is @5 more Gs than mine... but look at the Corolla.","1"
"I love it.","5"
"And I drove them all.","4"
" If this helps in anyway, i had a new 2012 elantra which needless to say sucked. Yea all it has on this car is probably fuel economy and modern interior, but corolla hands down beats the elantra bc of the QUALITY. Toyotas are way more dependable and this car is sturdy and i love it. My old car for a brand new car actually had loose wire issues so i brought it to the dealer 4 times for numerous issues. ( getting stuck in park/ drive). Suspension sucks as well, car slips alot. Can barely go over 60 on the highway over few bumps with out noticing slips . So to me corolla s is AWESOME! No slips..great suspension, very comfortable to me and i dont have to worry which is the best peace of mind :)","1"

" Bought the car used in Aug. '06 with only 3,300 miles on it from a private owner. Complaints are only minor: sun visor on driver's hits the rear-view mirror every time you pull it down and put it back up, it's annoying to have to readjust the mirror every time the sun is in your eyes. Other major complaint is driving position, I'm 6' tall and have to have the seat pushed all the way back for leg room, when I do that, the steering wheel is too far, since it does not telescope out( corrected on '09 and newer Corollas).","1"

" If you are looking for a high mileage, sporty, reliable commuter, this is the car for you.  I went through 3 months of research on the Honda Civic, Mazda 3, and this car.  For the money, my needs as a 70 mile commuter a day, Toyota reliability.  The decision was easily made.  I love the look of the car looks much better than the smiley Mazda or the alien looking Civic.   Some notes to those that read other peoples review.  The suspension is sport tuned so the steering is a little light at first but with a little break in the steering is more weighted and is easy to drive.","1"
"Out of the three cars I mentioned road noise was lowest for this car which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Excellent mpg ~ 40, very good build quality I had everything checked over by a mechanic, love the look, price.","1"
"The price I got for the car $16,995 for the S model, sunroof, etc. was great, but I wish body side molding came standard instead of accessory, the clock on the bottom is driver usable but could be positioned better.","1"
" Being that this is my first car, I don't have much experience on owing other cars, but I can tell you that I truly love this sporty Corolla S! The exterior looks sharp with the alloy wheels, fog lights, spoiler; it completes the package! The black cloth interior with the super bright and sporty gauges are awesome! The black interior is much better then the tan LE cloth. The only thing I don't really like is where the digital clock is located. It really makes you take your eyes off the road. The engine has enough pep to get you moving; not crazy fast nor super slow. I have also been averaging 35mpg! Can't beat that! I would reccomend this vehicle to anyone! A great and reliable Toyota!","1"

I have done minor repairs, new distributor cap and new plugs and wires, new tires and battery. I drive this car 120 miles a day 4 days a week sometimes more. It now has 239,500 miles and I hope it keeps on going. It truly is a gem and I got a steal. It made my 500$ back long ago! I want another one!

" I bought this car with about 100,000 miles and put another 20,000 on myself until I wrecked it this year.  This was a car that I could always count on to start.  Mechanically, it had very few problems.  The struts went out, the interior door handles broke, the radio never worked and the fasteners for the bumper guard came apart so if you drove at high speeds the bumper guard would sometimes come loose.  Overall I would reccomend these cars as a good A to B vehicle, but in the future I will never own one again if I can afford something nicer.  It was never a joy to drive, handled poorly, no pick-up on acceleration and starts vibrating pretty bad around 70 mph.","1"

" My 1996 Toyota Corolla is the best car I have ever owned. Front to back, inside and out, I just love everything about it. Toyota sure knew what they were doing when they made this car. They equipped it with the convenience of keyless remote entry, an alarm system, and anti theft system. The highly efficient 4 cylinder is almost self-maintained, and if necessary, very easily repaired. There's plenty of room inside for the passengers to ride comfortably, large enough trunk space for regular cargo storage. It handles so well, it seems to just float down the highway. This car has no problems holding it's own out on the road. And at 40 miles per gallon, who would ever want to drive anything else?","1"
"Well it would be hard to choose a favorite feature. Between the leg room, head room, quiet cabin, handling and suspension, every feature is my favorite. But if I had to narrow it down to one, I would have to say the fuel efficiency of this car is","1"

When it was paid off I just used the money I saved over a year and spruced up the engine. This car has become my favorite and of course well cared for still classy (did I mention Paid for). I started sprucing it up now everyone wants to buy it - sorry no sale here. I tricked it now it's completely mine. Have to thank TRD Japan for its good supplies in the Asian Market for this vehicle. USA did not supply the 93 to 96 corollas well... stylish gas saver and good ole lil' car","1"

" I bought this car new and drove it for the past 13 years without any major problems. I replaced the tires and breaks but nothing else. Was planning to drive this car until it wouldn't run anymore but it was totalled in an accident. Luckily I wasn't seriously hurt because of the way the Toyotas are built. I was on the highway when the accident happened so it could have been much worse than it was. The body of the vehicle took a beating in the accident but nothing came through to the inside of the car. Very safe car!","1"
"Excellent gas mileage! I used to get over 300 miles to a tank of gas!","4"
"I always had some trouble with the defrost in the car, seemed like my windows always stayed fogged up in the rain. I'm sure that's not a problem with the new Corollas.","1"
" The most practical and reliable car I've ever owned.  In 13 years/153,000 miles, in addition to oil changes/fluid checks, the only repairs I've had are: water pump replacement, timing belt replacement, front and rear brakes, and dash board light replacement.  I love the manual locks and doors... less to break.","1"
"Plain, simple, functional, reliable.  The station wagon has ample space.","3"
" I wrote a review in 2007 about how great this car is and it is just as terrific now.  What a totally reliable vehicle, how do I get another one just like it, maybe I won't ever need another one? I have 187,000 miles on it now.  I think the body style looks current and the seats/mats are better quality than the 2009 Civic. Plenty of acceleration for me, excellent mileage, great A/C and defrost, perfect usable size. I can't believe the resale value now is only $1,000, it is worth so much more.","1"

"I don't like recent exterior design of the Corolla, and it is only reason that I didn't buy a new Toyota Corolla again after I sold mine.","1"
" We've used this car as a daily commuter and grocery getter for over seven years and it still hangs tough. The check engine light stays on for no reason that the mechanic can find, but it still runs well. One day we'll move up to something more modern, but for basic, economical transportation it will still be running around town when today's Dodge Calibers and Nissan Versas are toast. Those who survive the apocalypse will be driving Corollas.","1"

I'm a nutzoid driver who makes the passengers eat the side windows when I take the curves.  The ride is fairly quiet and fairly smooth.  Reliability is already spoken for and that is, get your basic service, and it will survive a nuclear blast.

No doubt they are huge and ponderous to drive and like any other large SUV are big boxes in the wind that return poor gas mileage. However, for pure reliability and comfort, toyota comes thru. This is a pricey vehicle, no doubt, and you would expect memory seats and a more appointed interior, but a true toyota buyer does his homework thoroughly up front and knows their strength is in the fact that you will own this vehicle for years to come and when you move on, most likely your loyalty will remain with toyota","1"

Because it is a diesel powered car, the fuel consumption is much better than the gas models. It has great stability and efficiently corrects any tendency to sway in speedy curves.  Design is extremely sturdy and strong but heavy acceleration is remarkably good.  Service prices are quite reasonable. Rational design allows for very fast service and time/mileage between required service is highly competitive.","1"

" My family has owned six (6!) Land Cruisers over the years, but I was the black sheep who strayed and purchased a Range Rover.

I also love the interior appointments, and the stateliness of the exterior styling, and think of it as everything the Range Rover should be without the constant trips to the shop.

" Traded In 2004 BMW X5 for first Toyota Landcruiser and could not be happier.  The Landcruiser is much bigger and roomier.  Interior room is spacious and comfortable and build quality is excellent.  Fuel economy is fair, but this is expected with a vehicle of this size and weight.  The Landcruiser rides and handles exceptionally well for a large SUV.  The ride is smooth and comfortable and even more enjoyable on long trips.  The cabin is full of driver amenities and the vehicle is built with quality and Toyota reliability.  The 275 HP engine is smooth and responsive.  Love the Bluetooth capability.  Satellite radio is an option that should come standard for the price of this SUV. The best SUV.","1"

" Picked up the car from the dealership when purchased and the car was making a ear piercing noise coming from the wheels.","3"
"Ended up being the brake shields rubbing the brake rotors.","4"
" The car is not that good looking to begin with, but it comes in any color you want as long as its white, black, 50 shades of grey, or Christmas tree ornament blue or red, very boring.  You get what you pay for, but surprisingly  for the price the fit and finish are very good.. The interior does seem to contain a lot of shiny cheap plastic.  They also put a lot of emphasis on back seat legroom, but they didn't leave any upfront and that makes the car uncomfortable on a long trip.  I have already stopped to stretch my legs so as not to get a DVT.","1"
"My major complaint is the CV transmission.  I'm sure this may be an adequate transmission is a state that is flat, or in a snowmobile; but where I live It is very hilly and there is the problem.   First it is noisy under acceleration and that acceleration is very poor.  It is slower that the 4 speed automatic it replaced and a snail when compared to a manual shift. The engine races when accelerating, and  it seems you are always waiting for the transmission to catch up.  The RPM are all over the place, and passing can take a long time and be dangerous.  Toyota put phony shift points in a transmission that doesn't shift; this is very irritating and it is one more thing to go wrong.  I wonder what Toyota was thinking?  Has anyone asked why the 2018 Camry started with a clean sheet of paper and they didn't put a CVT in that car?  My theory is that this transmission is light duty only.","1"
"Instead of gears there is a belt between two drums, and unlike a gear that meshes, the belts probably need a high coefficient of friction to function and friction  spells wear.  I was going to purchase this car until a friend, who is a transmission technician , suggested I lease it because in about 60k-70k miles there is a good chance of transmission failure. Visits to various websites appears to bear that out.  If the factory has all this confidence with this gum band transmission why don't they offer a longer FACTORY warranty to give the buyer peace of mind? If there are a lot of problems model wide, resale will suffer.  Before you buy one insist on an overnight test drive to see if you can live with it.  Why can't Toyota give us options like a 6 speed auto, 5 speed manual, or a dual clutch auto?","1"
"There really is no alternative except Kia, Hyundai, or Mazda since the Honda civic, Nissan Sentra, and Nissan Altima also have CVTs.  I realize that auto companies are being forced into this with CAFE averages, but I'm not happy with this transmission and a potential of a $4500+ replacement charge, when it is out of warranty, so they can meet the CAFE and be able to sell a Tundra. This is just my opinion, but if you are buying for the long term maybe you should research CVTs on some websites","1"
"Other complaints are lack of road feel, visibility is poor, and one has no idea where the front bumper is (maybe they need an upfront camera too), too much pedal travel in the brake, and difficulty getting in and out","1"
" After doing my research on the 2017 Corolla I bought the XSE with Nav. So far I like the car for what it is drives nice ok power fairly comfortable. So after a week of ownership I needed foglights being told by sale staff that the did have them guess what it dose not. So long story short i'm stuck Toyota needs to pull there heads out and equip these cars correctly no fog lights how much could they cost really.Other than that i'm pretty happy with the car.But I won't but abother Toyota product bad customer service both corp and dealers.","1"
" I have only had this car a little over a day.  I drive 45-60 minutes one way to work everyday.  So a total of 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours a day in my car.  If you do any kind of long distance driving, beware, the seats are extremely uncomfortable.  There is zero support.   Also, hard to get in and out of unless you are young in age and or in great shape.   I wish I would have paid more attention before I leased it.","1"
" Really happy with my new Corolla. I replaced my 10 year-old Matrix with this fully-loaded version. So far I'm more than happy. If it serves me as well as did my Matrix, I couldn't recommend it too highly.","1"
" I have been a Toyota fan since I bought my first one in the 1960's, I haven't owned any other brand and I was never disappointed until 2016. I was extremely happy with my 2004 and never would have given it up(it only had 48,000 mi.) if it wasn't totaled by another driver. At low speeds(30mph) the car hesitates as if I am continually touching the brake. At highway speed (60mph) the car does not hold the road and drifts, so I am constantly steering to hold the car steady. At my six month checkup they told me the car was performing normally and this was backed up by a case manager at Toyota headquarters. I have the temperature set at 66 degrees, but the air always seems too hot or too cold. I am short and I find the visibility poor. I am also over 65 so I am not a fan of having to program everything,but that's my problem, not the car's. Well, that's enough complaining for now. I have gotten used to the car so it's not as bad as when I first got it. One good thing is that the hesitation has stopped, but it took a year.","1"
" First, there is a lot of things right with this car.  Fit and Finish are great, and there are no squeaks or rattles, and the price (with discounts) make it a better deal than a Honda.  If everything else after that was just average I would be satisfied, BUT.  The transmission is horrible.  The CVT works great in snowmobile, but does it belong in a car?  The engine is always revving to a high rpm range when you accelerate, and you wait for the transmission to catch up.  It is dangerous when you try to pass or merge from an on ramp.  This creates a lot of noise in the cabin.  I know now why the salesman went with me on the test drive, picked the route (city streets), and never stopped talking.  It was so I wouldn't notice how bad the noise or tranny was.  I took the car on a 100 mile trip to my parents house and my back hurt and I'm young, skinny, and a runner.  when you take a test drive leave the salesman at the dealer.  If they insist on going along, walk away.  Drive onto a highway, try merging with traffic, try to pass, and you won't buy it. The car is so slow and hesitant that it is almost dangerous.  I am going to trade this car on a Honda or Nissan next year, take the bath, and never look back .   What we need is a law that you can return the car in 48 hours and I bet that a lot of people will.","1"
" My family has enjoyed the use of a 1998 Corolla that was purchased new. For the past eighteen years and more than 235,00 miles, problem free driving was ours with only routine scheduled maintenance. Two weeks ago we decided to purchase a new Corolla. We test drove the 2017 Corolla. The lack of comfort and the level of road noise in "that cabin", as compared to what we had become accustomed to in our 1998 model was no small matter. The noise especially, was so annoying that we decided to purchase a Camry after giving one a test drive that very same day. I had learned from the sales manager that a lot of owners of our generation Corolla had decided to upgrade to a new Camry instead of repeating their purchase of a new Corolla after test driving the new Corolla. The manager also mentioned that Toyota made certain design changes between the model years that probably contributed to the issues we had with the new Corolla.","1"
" I read all the reviews before purchase and I am really happy with this car. It is a great value. The safety features that come standard are awesome. I like the radar-responsive cruise control for highway commuting, as well as the lane alert. The design of the car is such that there are very few blind spots. The seat is very comfortable, and it is just comfortable to drive. The turning radius is great and it is very responsive. I live in a city with hills and I love the hill assist feature--no rolling back! It is also great for city parking. The temperature control and sound system are wonderful. The gas mileage is fantastic! And this is a car which holds its value and comes with years of mainteance support, keeping the mainteance costs lows. The only two areas that could be improved are consistent with what the fancy car reviewers say: 1) it could go from 0 to 60 a little faster. That being said, it is consistent with other value cars that I have driven. No better but no worse. 2) The gear shifts in lower gears are a little louder than they could be. There are quieter cars out there. But overall this is car is a great value! I needed a car at a good price, that would hold its value, had great fuel efficiency, high safety standards and low maintenance costs. This car wins in all those categories. And it is fun to drive. The bonus for us is that the trunk is big enough to take the two kids camping, and the 60/40 split means one person can sit in the back seat and we can still haul longer items. Very pleased!","1"
" Pros: Superb headlights with every even and bright illumination; tight fit and finish, very solid construction; low operating cost.  Cons: If you want to know what it feels like driving a coffin this is it! Very dark claustrophobic interior, poor outward visibility; noisy at speed; poor straight line stability; persistent and irritating understeer. Boring exterior design.  Some very hard and sharp plastic in the wrong spots that really will hurt you.","1"
" We have it for about one month. So far we like it. As a family car it is great. The thing I like most is, the Adaptive cruise control and line departure alert. Also LED lights great when driving in dark","1"
" I purchased a Corolla because of its reliability and good reputation, and I absolutely loved everything about this car at first. Unfortunately, my little dream car turned into a nightmare a mere 3 weeks after purchase. While stopped at a red light, an error message popped up on the dash saying "Charging System Malfunction" and I thought it was just an issue with my GPS, which was plugged into the outlet. I unplugged it and then another message popped up, this time saying "Oil pressure low" followed by messages saying to consult my owners manual and to take the car in for service. I was at an intersection and tried to turn onto the side road, only to find I had no accelerator power. I was slamming on the gas trying to move, and I was only able to do so because I was going downhill. Two good samaritans helped push me to safety, but to my horror I had NO brakes while the car was in neutral. I had to shift the car into park and lurch to a stop. One of the guys who helped suggested turning off and restarting the car, and sure enough the error messages went away. Still, I had it towed to the dealership, after dealing with Toyota Care and waiting 2 hours for the tow truck to get there. To condense this novel, the car threw no error codes when service checked it, and they're maintaining that nothing is wrong with the car. I've had to open a case with Toyota and I honestly can't believe what a horrible experience the whole thing has been. More effort has been put into attacking my credibility and denying what happened than it has in actually fixing what's obviously a major issue. For a brand new car to malfunction and impede my ability to control it is unacceptable, and I will not be driving it again. I really hope I was just sold a lemon and that no other owners experience these issues, but I will NEVER buy a Toyota again. They do not stand behind their products, and I highly recommend taking your business to a manufacturer that does.","1"
" 2013 Corolla LE w/ complete package. Cute, stylish & economical car. Was averaging around 30-34 mpg in town. Full tank gets you 400 miles + . Had steering wheel issue but the problem was fixed by dealership under warranty. Touch screen display not as responsive & had to push it a couple times. Entunes could use some improvement. The sound system is nice. Loved my sunroof. Sometimes it's much nicer to drive a smaller car because you can make quick u turns & fit into smaller parking areas. I really liked this car but it didn't have enough power for me. I didn't feel comfortable merging on to busy freeways/highways. Also space & leg room felt kind of tight. Other than that this is a great car.","1"
"Body Style, Lights, Sunroof, Sound System, Economical. Fun to drive in town.","5"
"More leg room. Entunes touch display needs to be more responsive. More sturdy door handles, the plastic feels cheap & easy to break off. The sideview mirror control needs to be on the door panel not under the driver's side ac vent. A little more power under the hood. The electrical power steering could be more quiet while turning wheel, almost sounds like plastic rubbing on plastic.","1"
" I just bought a 2013 Corolla S loaded. I am still in the high from it. I can tell you that thing is nice! It's not a boring ride at all. I have plenty of power for traffic maneuvering. I love how it has a luxury ride feel and how spaciousness the cabin is. I think it looks very cool and hip...especially at night.","1"

I drove both cars, owned the new Dart and sold it, driven the Chevy Cruise and Noisy Mazda 3. Out of all the cars I did like the new Civic the most, however their price premium at dealer lots is not worth what you get on Civic Vs. Corolla. The new 2014 Corolla doesn't change much from the old and I didn't feel the need to wait for the newer model. The car is quiet, smooth, and build quality compared to the Dart isn't even close. The Focus was small on the inside compared to the Corolla and I would buy another Corolla in the future.","1"

" I bought my Toyota Corolla S 2007 in fall of 2006, and named her Libby. Truth be told, I have had prettier (aesthetically pleasing) cars, but no car has ever matched her reliability. She is now 216,000 miles old and still keeps on keeping on. When I got her, I was single and now 7 years later, we have a 7 year old daughter, 2 big dogs and Libby. My husband's truck is in the shop, and Libby has been our single vehicle off/on since 2008. In 2012-current, I've had a relatively long commute for my job, upwards of 45-60 min one way, so both ways everyday - Lots of driving. Libby is a true workhorse, and we ensure she is has regular maintenance (full synthetic oil changes, etc.). She's never, knock on wood, had any major repair. Right now she needs new shocks/struts (front/back) because we've lived in some very rural areas with lots of pot holes, dips and rough terrain. I'm on this website right now because we're searching for a bigger family vehicle, and will likely give Libby to a family friend while she job searches. I want to say the Toyota Corolla S is outstanding value, reliability and performance. It is not made for fast rides and showing off, but for a solid smaller sedan that excels in endurance and good quality!","1"
" This is an impressive car in all respects. Exterior design is very attractive with the S package but I prefer it without the spoiler. Build quality is outstanding. Love the ride and handling and fuel mileage seems to meet spec--I've had my car for a week. It's quieter on the road than I thought it would be. Seats are comfortable but I have to agree with some other reviewers that the driver cushion is  a little short ( and I have short legs).I also agree with others who complain about needing a telescoping wheel. Horsepower is adequate. Amazing trunk size for a compact. I recently drove a Caliber and it cannot match the Corolla in any category. I'm glad I bought my Corolla.","1"
" Bought this car one month ago.  I love it.  40 mpg overall avg with 25%city/75% hwy after 2000 miles.  Handles well and acceleration with the 5 speed is great.  The drivers seat takes some getting used to, not the most comfortable.  I am 5'll'' and 195lbs and the seat and front leg room are only adequate for my size.  I would not recommend this car to anyone above 6'2'' or 220lbs. The build quality is typically Toyota solid.  My backup car is a 93 Corolla that has 222,000miles on it and still runs great, so I am hoping the reliability will be the same with the 07.  Overall, its a well built car with excellent resale value, is great on gas, and has a history of bulletproof reliability.","1"

" I purchased my 2007 Toyota Corolla LE, 5-speed manual transmission car from a dealer in 2011 after parting ways with my '96 Honda Civic. I love this car. It has great get up and go and is super reliable. When I first got this car, I had a long highway commute each day and I got amazing gas mileage (36 MPG). Two years ago, I moved and my commute is now a 10 minute drive through town and even though my MPG dropped is is still averaging about 33 MPG. Not bad!","1"
"When I purchased the car it had 75,000 miles on it and since then I have nearly doubled that to 135,000 miles. It is still going strong. No issues. No super expensive repairs, just regular maintenance. This car is great! I had planned (and would love) to drive this car until it refuses to go anymore but our family acquired two large dogs so I am forced to seek out a larger vehicle. But I am sad to see my car go! I would buy it again in a heartbeat!","1"
" At first, I was hesitant to buy such a compact car since I have driven nothing but SUV's. I sold my 2003 Suburbam about a month ago because of gas prices but when my brother told me about the Corolla I paid attention. I was looking for economical car anyways and went to test drive it. I was hooked as soon as I drove it.It rides smoothly, it has power and it is fun to drive. The features I got for the price, automatic transmission, power mirrors, CD, outside temperture and AC all for the outrageous price of $11,998.00 is a heck of a deal.","1"

" I'm 65 years old and this Corolla just makes me like it more each time I drive it. In the city it runs around like a peppy little rabbit and on the highway it handles 75 mph speed limits like you are going 50. Fully loaded with 3 big adults and luggage and coolers (the trunk is larger than you think) cruising at 75 mph our gas mileage was 37 & 38 mpg. Less money and better equipped than all the other vehicles I tested. In a few years I may give this car to my grandson and then I may try a Camry.

" If this helps in anyway, i had a new 2012 elantra which needless to say sucked.

Toyotas are way more dependable and this car is sturdy and i love it. My old car for a brand new car actually had loose wire issues so i brought it to the dealer 4 times for numerous issues. ( getting stuck in park/ drive). Suspension sucks as well, car slips alot. Can barely go over 60 on the highway over few bumps with out noticing slips . So to me corolla s is AWESOME!

" Second time around Camry Hybrid owner, did over 60k miles in my 2010 all trouble free but was suffering a boredom attack so wanted to try the 2012 model, pretty much the same except for the little EVO button, press it in and be ready for some fun, even will give the V6 a run for its money and still do 40 MPG","1"

" If you are looking for a high mileage, sporty, reliable commuter, this is the car for you.  I went through 3 months of research on the Honda Civic, Mazda 3, and this car.  For the money, my needs as a 70 mile commuter a day, Toyota reliability.  The decision was easily made.  I love the look of the car looks much better than the smiley Mazda or the alien looking Civic.   Some notes to those that read other peoples review.  The suspension is sport tuned so the steering is a little light at first but with a little break in the steering is more weighted and is easy to drive.","1"
"Out of the three cars I mentioned road noise was lowest for this car which is a huge pet peeve of mine.  Excellent mpg ~ 40, very good build quality I had everything checked over by a mechanic, love the look, price.","1"
"The price I got for the car $16,995 for the S model, sunroof, etc. was great, but I wish body side molding came standard instead of accessory, the clock on the bottom is driver usable but could be positioned better.","1"
" Being that this is my first car, I don't have much experience on owing other cars, but I can tell you that I truly love this sporty Corolla S! The exterior looks sharp with the alloy wheels, fog lights, spoiler; it completes the package! The black cloth interior with the super bright and sporty gauges are awesome! The black interior is much better then the tan LE cloth. The only thing I don't really like is where the digital clock is located. It really makes you take your eyes off the road. The engine has enough pep to get you moving; not crazy fast nor super slow. I have also been averaging 35mpg! Can't beat that! I would reccomend this vehicle to anyone! A great and reliable Toyota!","1"

" I bought this car 3 years ago with 193,000 for 500 dollars. I know crazy. It has never left me walking. I have done minor repairs, new distributor cap and new plugs and wires, new tires and battery. I drive this car 120 miles a day 4 days a week sometimes more. It now has 239,500 miles and I hope it keeps on going. It truly is a gem and I got a steal. It made my 500$ back long ago! I want another one! I drive a 4 door Dodge 3/4 ton diesel so tjis car saves me so much money running back and forth to work! Sometimes I'd really Rather be in my Toyota than that Dodge!","1"

" I bought this car with about 100,000 miles and put another 20,000 on myself until I wrecked it this year.  This was a car that I could always count on to start.  Mechanically, it had very few problems.  The struts went out, the interior door handles broke, the radio never worked and the fasteners for the bumper guard came apart so if you drove at high speeds the bumper guard would sometimes come loose.  Overall I would reccomend these cars as a good A to B vehicle, but in the future I will never own one again if I can afford something nicer.  It was never a joy to drive, handled poorly, no pick-up on acceleration and starts vibrating pretty bad around 70 mph.","1"

" My 1996 Toyota Corolla is the best car I have ever owned. Front to back, inside and out, I just love everything about it. Toyota sure knew what they were doing when they made this car. They equipped it with the convenience of keyless remote entry, an alarm system, and anti theft system. The highly efficient 4 cylinder is almost self-maintained, and if necessary, very easily repaired. There's plenty of room inside for the passengers to ride comfortably, large enough trunk space for regular cargo storage. It handles so well, it seems to just float down the highway. This car has no problems holding it's own out on the road. And at 40 miles per gallon, who would ever want to drive anything else?","1"

" had this reliable and peppy wagon for ten years; no major defects or problems; easy to park; good visibility; good loading capacity; good leg room in back; upholstery wears well; std stereo mediocre; gas mileage appx 26-28 city; 28-30 freeway; would have bought another but don't make anymore; driver's seat and headrest are comfortable for my neck and frame (5'6").","1"

" I purchased this vehicle off the lot brand new, never had any major problems just regular maintenance and general upkeep changed a few batteries, timing belt after 100K and struts on the 150k mark it needed it. When it was paid off I just used the money I saved over a year and spruced up the engine. This car has become my favorite and of course well cared for still classy (did I mention Paid for). I started sprucing it up now everyone wants to buy it - sorry no sale here. I tricked it now it's completely mine. Have to thank TRD Japan for its good supplies in the Asian Market for this vehicle. USA did not supply the 93 to 96 corollas well... stylish gas saver and good ole lil' car","1"

" I bought this car new and drove it for the past 13 years without any major problems. I replaced the tires and breaks but nothing else. Was planning to drive this car until it wouldn't run anymore but it was totalled in an accident. Luckily I wasn't seriously hurt because of the way the Toyotas are built. I was on the highway when the accident happened so it could have been much worse than it was. The body of the vehicle took a beating in the accident but nothing came through to the inside of the car. Very safe car!","1"

"I always had some trouble with the defrost in the car, seemed like my windows always stayed fogged up in the rain. I'm sure that's not a problem with the new Corollas.","1"
" The most practical and reliable car I've ever owned.  In 13 years/153,000 miles, in addition to oil changes/fluid checks, the only repairs I've had are: water pump replacement, timing belt replacement, front and rear brakes, and dash board light replacement.  I love the manual locks and doors... less to break.","1"
"Plain, simple, functional, reliable.  The station wagon has ample space.","3"
" I wrote a review in 2007 about how great this car is and it is just as terrific now.  What a totally reliable vehicle, how do I get another one just like it, maybe I won't ever need another one? I have 187,000 miles on it now.  I think the body style looks current and the seats/mats are better quality than the 2009 Civic. Plenty of acceleration for me, excellent mileage, great A/C and defrost, perfect usable size. I can't believe the resale value now is only $1,000, it is worth so much more.","1"

"I don't like recent exterior design of the Corolla, and it is only reason that I didn't buy a new Toyota Corolla again after I sold mine.","1"
" We've used this car as a daily commuter and grocery getter for over seven years and it still hangs tough. The check engine light stays on for no reason that the mechanic can find, but it still runs well. One day we'll move up to something more modern, but for basic, economical transportation it will still be running around town when today's Dodge Calibers and Nissan Versas are toast. Those who survive the apocalypse will be driving Corollas.","1"

" I had the stripper model.  3 speed transmission, 33mpg hwy.  The performance is fairly good, but I would steer away from the 3 speed trans.  This car handles very nicely.  I'm a nutzoid driver who makes the passengers eat the side windows when I take the curves.  The ride is fairly quiet and fairly smooth.  Reliability is already spoken for and that is, get your basic service, and it will survive a nuclear blast.  Not to mention I rolled this car a few times on the fwy going 60, and it held up VERY well.  Definitely a safe car to drive.  I came out without a SCRATCH.","1"

It was repaired, you can't even tell it was ever in an accident. It drives like a dream, and don't have to tell you that 30+ mpg is excellent these days.
