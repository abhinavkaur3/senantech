However, it's not easy to see why - it's an immensely practical and well-built van.", "The Crafter sits at the top of VW's commercial vehicle range, above the ", ' and the ', '. The ', ', launched in 2006 (and the Volkswagen LT before it) shared a platform with the Mercedes Sprinter, but for 2016 Volkswagen has struck out on its own and created an all-new model.\xa0', 'In 2015, VW sold a shade over 8,000 Crafters to UK customers and a total of just over 50,000 worldwide. It sold 430,000 vans globally in the same 12-month period and the desire is there for the Crafter to grow its volumes, contributing a bigger proportion of those global van sales. That is where this new Volkswagen Crafter comes in.\xa0', '• ', "VW may no longer be working with Mercedes, but it's not going it completely alone. The Crafter comes out of the factory in Poland in two guises - one badged as a VW, and the other badged as a MAN TGE. This is purely badge-engineering, as the two vans are identical bar the front-end styling.", 'The new van draws on the extensive Volkswagen group parts catalogue with a range of 2.0-litre TDI diesel engines and interior design that will be familiar not only to Caddy and Transporter van operators but to those who own Volkswagen passenger cars too. \xa0', 'Infotainment and safety technology is also carried over so the Crafter now gets many of the advanced features found elsewhere in the VW firmament. Standard safety kit on all models includes four airbags, ESP stability control, Automatic Post-Collision Braking System and side-wind assist, while Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Assist and Front-Assist emergency braking are options.', 'The look of the VW Crafter is also very much in line with Volkswagen family themes but in the wake of the previous model Crafter and its gawky front end, many will see that as a good thing. Volkswagen has gone with its current design signature of a slim grille sporting a large central badge connecting headlights with bold daytime running light configuration.', '• ', 'If anything, it’s the Crafter’s flanks that are most striking with the eye drawn to the deep crease running along the underside of the door handles then down the length of the van. The sharply sculpted wheelarches are connected by a thick protective plastic strip (a ‘go-carefully stripe’, if you will) that runs along the van’s lower quarters and gives it a purposeful, planted stance on the road.\xa0', "Many of the improvements to the Crafter are impressive but predictable. Not all of them though. The key area where this Volkswagen panel van has extended its on-paper appeal is in the breadth of its range. The core panel van models offer three roof heights and three load lengths but these are joined by 5-seater double cab models as well as dropside and tipper trucks. This gives a total of 69 different configurations, but there's more options than just body style. The Crafter is now available with front, rear or 4Motion four-wheel drive, giving an even broader array of choice to operators.\xa0", 'It all means that the Volkswagen Crafter can offer gross vehicle weights of up to 5.5 tonnes, cargo volumes up to 18.4m3 and load heights up to 2,196mm. Operators who couldn’t get a Crafter to accommodate their needs in the past now probably can and that should see it instantly appear on more van buying shortlists.\xa0', 'In general, Volkswagen has achieved a remarkably car-like driving experience with the Crafter. Engine refinement and economy are not class leading but ride quality is excellent, as is the cabin design and the array of safety equipment. ']}
