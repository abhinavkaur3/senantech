Letter from the Chairman 
and the CEO

In 2016, we also announced a collaboration with Waymo (formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project) and the 
completion of 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid vehicles purpose built for fully self-driving operations. This marked the first 
time that Google has worked directly with an automaker to integrate its self-driving system, including sensors and 
software, into a passenger vehicle.

To begin 2017, at the CES in Las Vegas, we revealed the Chrysler Portal concept, a semi-autonomous electric vehicle 
that is engineered to be upgradeable as advances in technology enable higher levels of autonomy and designed to 
grow with millennials through their life stages.

We have made significant progress since unveiling our five-year strategic plan in 2014, and for 2017 we have issued 
guidance that confirms our conviction in achieving the key targets we have set for 2018. For full-year 2017, we expect 
Net revenues of between €115 billion and €120 billion, Adjusted EBIT in excess of €7 billion, Adjusted net profit of 
more than €3 billion and Net industrial debt to be further reduced to below €2.5 billion by year-end.

Our approach to achieving profitable growth includes expanding our business globally while always remaining mindful 
of how our actions affect the world in which we operate. This commitment to playing a positive role is fundamental to 
the character of our Group. It reflects our core belief that achieving sustainable economic results requires a balanced 
approach that also contributes to the environment and society as a whole.

We are convinced that the objectives we have set for the future, together with the significant steps we have already 
taken, are clear evidence that our approach to sustainability is not only pragmatic, but it is deeply rooted in our culture 
and central to our mission.

In fact, our efforts have been recognized by the world’s leading sustainability rating agencies.

In addition, our targets are aligned with the inspirational principles that drive the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) initiative, which addresses the global challenge of sustainable development. And, our 
global sustainable best practices are aligned with the European Union Commission’s efforts to stimulate the transition 
towards a circular economy that maximizes the value and use of materials, products and waste.

To cite just a few examples, during 2016 we implemented more than 4,400 new environmental projects at our 
plants worldwide, leading to a reduction of the carbon footprint and about €70 million in savings. Projects targeted 
at reducing water consumption at our facilities resulted in 2.2 billion m3 of water being saved and €4.5 million in cost 
savings, with the recycling index reaching 98.9 percent.

Our plants also achieved a 5.5 percent reduction in waste generated and a 2.4 percent reduction in CO2 emissions 
in 2016. As a result of continuous improvements over the years, the percentage of electric energy used in our 
manufacturing activities that is derived from renewable sources reached 26.1 percent in 2016, and FCA automotive 
plants in Italy and Brazil now operate entirely on renewable energy.

Work-related injuries decreased by 17 percent at plants worldwide, marking the 10th consecutive year of improvement.

FCA encourages its employees to volunteer their time and skills to help build strong, self-reliant communities. In 2016, 
approximately 200,000 hours were volunteered worldwide by FCA employees. The Group also committed about €24 
million to local communities around the world.

FCA continues in its commitment to reducing the environmental impact of its products over their entire life cycle, while 
responding to consumer demands in each market.

FCA has been a leader in natural gas vehicles for more than 15 years, and in 2016 we presented the Fiat 500 M15, the 
first retail-ready Euro 6 compliant vehicle that can also run on a blend of gasoline and methanol (up to 15 percent).

We are also focused on improving our gasoline engines, and we have developed all-new global small and medium 
gasoline engine families, including the new three-cylinder Firefly engine launched in 2016.

As part of that mission and as an integral part of FCA’s long-term business plans, FCA is committed to complying with 
all applicable laws and regulations relating to vehicle emissions.

Finally, we aim to offer our employees a diverse and inclusive work environment. We are pleased that several third-party 
organizations have recognized our efforts in this area.

Our approach to business and to sustainable development are not two different things. They are guided by the same 
spirit and values, those values upon which we have built FCA: commitment, respect, integrity, and responsibility.

We have come a long way the past few years because we have nourished this spirit and we have held on to our 
values, recognizing that we have a vital stake in each other’s success.

Our unique strength as a company resides in our work ethic as well as our diversity, our openness, the accountability 
to deliver on our promises, and the way we respect each other. These values are what define us.

We continue in our commitment to building an organization that will stand the test of time by constantly innovating, 
remaining resilient in the face of changing circumstances, and focusing intensely on how to create a better future for 
our group, our communities and all of our stakeholders, inside and outside the Company.

We wish to thank everyone in the FCA organization for their hard work, their commitment to excel and their openness 
with each other across borders to achieve our goal of creating such an organization. We know there is immense 
talent within our company, and we will be able to leverage it to the extent that we continue to foster a collaborative 
environment that brings out the best in each other.

We also wish to thank our shareholders and all of our stakeholders for your continued support as we seek to build a 
stronger future for all of us.
