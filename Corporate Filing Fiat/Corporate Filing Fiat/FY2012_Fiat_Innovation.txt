SuSTAInABLE MOBILITy\
Fiat  Group  is  committed  to  meeting  the  mobility  needs  of  its\
customers, while reducing the environmental and social impact of\
vehicles over their entire life cycle. As part of that commitment,\
the  Group’s  research  and  innovation  activities  are  focused  on\
developing  solutions  for  increasingly  sustainable  mobility,  by\
reducing fuel consumption and emissions, as well as improving\
recyclability and safety. Continuous innovation is essential to the\
development of environmentally and socially sustainable products\
that are also affordable.\
\
Global Innovation\
As part of the collaboration between Fiat and Chrysler, activities\
have  expanded  from  development  of  common  models  and\
platforms to also include plans for shared research and innovation.\
In 2012, the Group launched the Global Innovation Process (GIP),\
which establishes a single framework for the coordination of all\
innovation activities worldwide. Developed by representatives from\
each of the Group’s Regions and coordinated by Fiat’s research\
center (CRF), the GIP covers all phases of the innovation process,\
from idea generation to pre-competitive development. On the basis\
of that framework, targets and guidelines were established at the\
global level and formalized in two strategic agendas:\
the  Strategic  Innovation  Agenda,  which  sets  short-  and\
medium-term objectives for product innovation and identifies\
\
\
related objectives and technological challenges\
\
the Strategic Research Agenda, which sets long-term innovation\
objectives and priorities for collaborative research\
At year-end 2012, the Group’s Research and Innovation activities\
involved some 17,900 individuals worldwide at 77 centers located\
across the four Regions (EMEA, NAFTA, LATAM and APAC).\
During  the  year,  the  Group  invested  approximately  €3.3  billion\
in R&D5, equivalent to around 4% of net revenues from Industrial\
Activities.\
Testimony to the significant results achieved over the years is the\
Group’s  intellectual  property  portfolio,  which  at  year-end  2012\
included more than 8,000 active patents.\
