In 2014, FCA conducted 14 internal sustainability-focused Stakeholder Engagement events in Italy, the U.S. and 
China. These events provided a platform for more than 400 employees representing the various business areas to 
express their views, needs and priorities. The participants took part in discussions and workshops that addressed the 
economic, environmental and social impacts of FCA’s activities. The events were also effective in identifying material 
aspects specific to each region.

Materiality Analysis
FCA’s sustainability reporting focuses on topics that have been determined to be material in accordance with the 
Global Reporting Initiative (G4) framework (“Material Aspects are those that reflect the organization’s significant 
economic, environmental and social impacts; or substantively influence the assessments and decisions of 
stakeholders”, Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Reporting Guidelines- G4, pg. 7).

In 2014, material topics identified in prior years were subjected to a thorough review and the FCA materiality diagram 
was updated accordingly (The materiality analysis was carried out in accordance with the AA1000 Stakeholder 
Engagement Standard guidelines for the steps relating to the identification, mapping and prioritization of stakeholders, 
and to the analysis of the results of their involvement. The guidance notes on Accountability and the criteria defined 
by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI-G4) were also followed with regard to outlining an approach to the materiality 
principle and the identification of material issues). In addition to the results from our stakeholder engagement activities, 
the determination of materiality also took into account strategic priorities, corporate values, competitive activities and 
social expectations.

An analysis of the scope of each material aspect confirmed that it has impacts throughout the entire organization 
and across all operating segments and regions. In addition, each aspect has impacts outside the organization in 
geographical areas where the Group operates and for all stakeholder categories identified.

Sustainability Disclosure

Research, Innovation and Sustainable Mobility
FCA is committed to meeting the mobility needs of customers, while reducing the environmental and social impact of 
vehicles over their entire life cycle. The Group’s global research and innovation activities are focused on developing 
solutions for increasingly sustainable mobility, by reducing fuel consumption and emissions, improving vehicle 
recyclability and safety, and developing new models of mobility. Continuous innovation is essential to development of 
products that are environmentally and socially sustainable, as well as affordable.

Innovating for Sustainable Products and Processes
All innovation activities worldwide are coordinated through a common framework, the FCA Global Innovation Process 
(GIP). Developed in collaboration with, and on the basis of, input from the Group’s four operating regions, the GIP 
covers all phases of the innovation process, from idea generation to pre-competitive development. As part of that 
process, guidelines and targets are then formalized in the Strategic Agenda.

During 2014, the process was further enhanced through improved integration of the four regions in several aspects of 
project definition and management. As a result, achievements for current projects were optimized and proposals for 
new initiatives were harmonized on the global level.

The process is coordinated centrally by the Chief Technology Officer who, as a member of the Group Executive 
Council, ensures alignment of the innovation process with the Group’s strategic objectives, and enables synergies and 
the transfer of new solutions across the Group’s global product portfolio.

At year-end 2014, the Group’s research and innovation activities involved approximately 20,000 individuals at 85 
centers worldwide.

During the year, the Group invested approximately €3.7 billion in R&D (Includes capitalized R&D and R&D charged 
directly to the income statement), representing around 3.9% of net revenues from Industrial Activities.

The Group’s innovation activities have generated a significant intellectual property portfolio over the years and, at year-
end 2014, FCA had a total of 8,311 registered patent applications and 3,719 protected product designs.
