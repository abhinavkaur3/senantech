9/5/2016," ""Use To Be Great"" ",2,Current Employee - Mid Stage Collections, Pros Job is easy at least mid stage collections. Talk to maybe 10 customers a day so a lot of down time chatting with your neighbors while skip tracing. You get to choose whether you want a 30| 45 or an hour long lunch. Vehicle leasing program. Work/life balance. , Cons I'm just disgusted how filthy the place is. It's so dusty that I now take an allegra everyday. I was also inherited the crustiest keyboard and dustiest cubicle out of training I almost quit right then and there feeling so disrespected. Toyota is #9 in global 500. It sure doesn't look like it in the building. Plus bonuses are awful. You get it once a year| not monthly like every other collections job. It makes working hard much harder when a little mistake can ruin your bonus that's 11 months away. Theres too many stats and metrics. If you're doing great in one metric it will counter another metric and you will get yelled at for not doing well on that metric. Company match is 4% and that's it. For a company as big as Toyota I expected more. Most companies that big match 5-6% and have a pension. They make it up with their vehicle leasing program but it's still more expensive than owning outright and you better like driving toyotas. In training you are learned how to do the job customer service focused but once you get on the floor that switch flips and you are expected to collect and basically be a stereotypical collector. I see a lot of new hires struggle with this because they don't set the right expectations in training. Career growth is difficult. If you want to move up you are going to have to do a lot of lateral moves to other departments making the same pay. ,-1,
21/4/2016," ""Great environment"" ",4,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee, Pros People genuinely about each other| great communication| philanthropy is actually a corporate metric| welcoming environment| management is committed to updating technology/processes| flexible work schedule. , Cons There are the natural pains associated with the relocation. Unique to Toyota is the culture shock that exists because of the company's dedication to promoting from within - having outsiders come in large numbers means challenging the status quo. Management is happy about that| not all team members are. Technology and resulting processes are shockingly outdated. ,0,

It is moving to Texas from LA and someone who is looking to save big time will be a good opportunity.9/80 option where you can work for 80 hours in 9 days and take a day off is something most FTE's make use of. , Cons Since it is a Japan company| you cannot expect less work.

2/4/2016," ""Great company - feels like a family rather than a job"" ",5,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee," Pros We all hear about ""Just in Time"" and ""Toyota Way""| but they don't describe the difference between Toyota and ""other companies"". The biggest difference comes in respect for people; Toyota put an inordinate amount of effort into looking after people. I have seen people go through long term injuries and be supported as if they were family| I have been to funerals of staff members where dozens of employees have turned up| and managers have been asked (by the family) to speak. Whilst I've always enjoyed good social relationships at work| I've never seen the extent of it that I do at Toyota.Career opportunities are also excellent| the company puts a big focus on moving people into new roles that challenge them. An annual cycle of promotions and rotations gives people regular opportunities to change career paths and develop as individuals. ", Cons Despite the focus on doing the right thing by people| Toyota is still a large company and suffers from many of the challenges that all large organisations do. Silos do exist| (some) politics does exist| and the general management challenges of communication and bureaucracy exist. Genuine efforts are made to tackle these| but don't expect utopia. ,0,

If you don't the open a system the way they want you to you get talked to. If you don't make your numbers you get talked to. They preach that TFS has a great work life balance but it's awful and they don't care about your personal life they just want their numbers. The training that was given was a joke and management can't understand why people can't make their numbers. ,0,

It's a great brand to work for| learning the Toyota Way and processes is invaluable to career growth. Currently great opportunities as they are moving the sales and marketing operation to Melbourne| so plenty of vacancies in sales & marketing. , Cons There is a fair bit of bureaucracy which results in slow decision making and plenty of iterations of strategy papers. It's a big company| people are very busy and tend to stick in their silos instead of communicating the bridge the silos. Biggest downside for me is that they are moving to Melbourne and I am not willing to move. ,0,

Not much office politics at the working level and colleagues are generally friendly. Good benefits and fat bonous. , Cons Very strong Japanese culture. You have to clock in and clock out| with management checking your time sheet every month. People have rigid mind set and are resistant to new ideas and changes. SOP is king! Everyone here seemed to love to engage in long winded and fruitless discussions and meetings| causing meaningless long working hours. Some training such as report makings and system knowledge are company specific and not useful outside toyota. Toyota called itself an international MNC| yet many meetings and reports are still conducted exclusively in Japanese. Worse of all| there is unspoken gender and nationality discrimination. 95% of middle to top management are Japanese. And If you are a female and a non-Japanese| its difficult to even get a management position. Basic pay is super low. All in all| this company kills individual creativity and what it need are just sheep which obey to management instructions without questions. ,0,

8/6/2015," ""Dream Job/Company.. Until Plano news."" ",4,Current Employee - Senior Risk Analyst, Pros TFS is a fantastic company to work for. They are all in on creating a good work/life balance with the flex works program now available company wide. The big ones for me are the 9/80 schedule| working from home (up to 2 days a week)| 50% tuition reimbursement and a decent benefits package. They are also heavily invested in community involvement and philanthropy so there is constantly a reminder that this company isn't just concerned with the bottom line. It was the first company I worked for in the auto sector where I felt that the upper management really cared about the employees.They have 5 band levels below the Corporate Manager level but those are being replaced with many more job levels to give the ladder a few more rungs with the same height. It should allow for more visible promotion opportunities and consistency between TMS| TFS and TEMA which will all be at one campus after relocating to Plano| TX in 2015-3017.They use a standard 1-5 scoring system for reviews without decimals and 5's being rarely dished. For band 3| if you are middle of the pack| you can expect a consistent 2-3% raise each year and a 10% bonus. If you are consistently over delivering and getting noticed for your effort then the raises can get up in the 7% range and the bonuses can get up in the 15-20% range.If you started working here before the end of 2014| you have the pension which vests after 5 years. Now they have an enhanced 401k for new hires where they contribute an additional % (I've heard it was 8%) of your salary to your 401k instead.If you make the move to TX they have a really generous relo pkg and if you were hired before the decision you get a big relo bonus on top with half paid at the move date and half 2 years later. Salaries are staying the same so you get the cost of living raise along with no state taxes. , Cons The company is moving their corporate offices to Plano| TX in 2017 with a decent chunk going earlier to get the headcount up enough to score some incentives from the state and city.Expectations of attrition are high so there is a fear that the workloads will get tough in certain groups once more people bail. ,-9,

As a larger corporation| we had very good health coverage| training on-site at corporate headquarters| monthly birthday celebrations| and very nicely done corporate events. I worked there nearly 11-1/2 years before the collections departments were consolidated and our office moved out of state. , Cons As a company/employer| not a lot; I did find that there was a lot of tolerance given to a couple particular managers who were very hard on some of their employees| and thought that they should have been more hands-on with protecting the plebes. ,-1,

27/10/2014," ""The demise of a good company"" ",2,Current Employee - Business Analyst, Pros Free coffee? Free water? Free parking?Free cups for the coffee? , Cons Company moving to Texas. I have heard that less than 40% of current employees will move from Torrance - that includes TMS.That means that Toyota will hire people in Texas.. Less quality people will be hired to replace current employees - ofcourse the new employees will be paid much less than Torrance employees - quality of work will decline. No more pension offered.It's a bad decision by Toyota to move to Texas..If Toyota really cared about their employees they would not be moving - this is all about moving to an 'employer' State| giving them an excuse to cut benefits (bye bye Pension)| cut salaries| change PTO policies (bye bye sick/vacation time). Get rid of alternate schedules (bye bye 980 Fridays off)..Now I get that Toyota wants to make MORE money - since 40 + billion in the bank isn't enough... But they are going to be HURTING once they realize that NO ONE wants to go to Texas (less than 40% is a lot of people to replace).. Everyone knows it takes Toyota 4-6 months to hire 1 person - which is GOOD as it means they really look for the right person for the job.... However - they can't do that when they need to replace 60% of people to run the operation in Texas.. That means they have to speed up their hiring practices - basically change their 'requirements' so that people can be hired at a fast pace.. That's where the 'lower quality' of associates comes from... They will be hiring people from 'job fairs!' The employees that go to Texas are going to have to PICK up their game because it is possible that they will be doing the job of 3 while Toyota hires their replacement co workers - and knowing that they are hiring people who are less qualified the Toyota employee has to 'put up with' working with people who are less qualified.. It's going to be a tough road for those associates who are going to Texas... Sadly - those same 'loyal' associates are going to get everything cut| wages| benefits| quality of life.. And have to work very very very hard to maintain their job department until the new under qualified people get up to speed..Toyota promotes 'Respect for people'.. But no one knows what that means - it's merely a 'motto' that has no definition. There is no onboarding program to teach the Toyota culture - or 'respect for people'. It is just lip service. Toyota just expects people to magically know what the Toyota culture is.. But the 'culture' and 'respect for people' does not exist... I really wish it did exist and that Toyota put some efforts and money into teaching their culture.. It is very evident that 'respect for people' is non existent... Especially the managers don't understand or practice respect for people and if you complain to HR about your boss who belittles you in front of other associates or talks negatively about you to other people (departments) - or treats you like a criminal - HR will protect the manager.. And say 'your manager has not broken any policies or laws.. ' and if you argue about the fact that your boss is belittling you - HR will say 'sometimes bosses jerks'. And you say 'what about the company motto respect for people'. - HR will redirect you and tell you 'maybe you should worry more about your job and less about company mottos!'It's sad that Toyota had become this company that lies about what they stand for - and they have trained their HR staff to protect their managers and the company..The move to Texas is the ultimate slap in the face regarding 'respect for people'Good luck to those that are loyal and go to Texas.. You will find out that Toyota isn't loyal to you in return. ,-8,

The name Toyota sounds impressive to most when you tell them that's who you work for. , Cons Warped sense of diversity and inclusion. Not a safe work environment to give your well thought thru business opinion. Management does want you to speak up about issues and often covers up issues. The culture is passive aggressive which mean you constantly have to watch your back. The pay is below what other captives and automakers are paying for the equivalent position. I've been with the company for a number of years and have only been promoted once....super slow in awarding promotions. Not very diverse workforce at the manager and above level. Not many minorities in management roles and those that are have more qualifications than non minorities in management roles. Toyota does not value education and only experience if you've gained it thru working for them. ,-3,

Upper management are very approachable.There is a cafeteria onsite that is heavily subsidized by the company making prices very reasonable.Work-Life balance is very good| they recently made their same day time off program more flexible. Some departments have flexible work schedules which can be helpful and they recently introduced part-time positions in some departments. , Cons The company used to be much more generous to their employees| outrageous Christmas parties and regular giveaways are all but gone. The monthly collections bonus program was recently eliminated effectively reducing income potential for top performers.A main frustration is that because Management styles vary so drastically between call center locations| the same departments at different sites are not held to the same standard. ,-2,

You work very hard and the pay and conditions are good. Most people behave in a rational| value driven way and targets and job output requirements are usually very clear. Everyday something new can be learnt and there is always someone around who knows the answer to your question. There are many systems| standards and processes in place that allow you to confidently proceed with your job. , Cons If you do a good job| there is little reward - you are just given more work to do.

29/12/2013," ""Makes many jealous"" ",5,Current Employee - Marketing Planning Officer, Pros Product Planning at Toyota is one of the dream jobs of the modern workforce. Besides being able to test drive cars like Jeremy Clarkson and co| in various locations around the world| there is an actual output in putting smiles across customers faces. A day's work involves studying market conditions of different countries| customer profiles and discussing key ingredients to add or subtract to the vehicle to leave the customer delighted.There is so much fun in this job that I have never woken up happier on Mondays and ended the week waiting for the next. I have dreamt about doing things at work in my sleep. That's not something everyone gets to enjoy in his/her lifetime.In terms of work| there is never restriction by job level. An entry-level employee can make changes to the entire company and output if he has enough passion and convincing power. Japanese culture dictates respect for each other above pure hierarchy bullying.Plenty of travel| meeting people| exchanging ideas and enjoying the sound and pleasure of driving - this is one of the dream jobs to hold.Company future: With promising future concepts| directions and an annoyingly strict quality control - confidence in Toyota and Toyota products is one of the best feelings a long-term employee can enjoy. The biggest change to Toyota's traditional mindset is the acceptance of European design and direction which propels Toyota from an ordinary mass-car maker towards one that makes highly durable cars offering high driving pleasure. , Cons Has one of the lowest base salaries for Singapore. Despite high recognition of global university ranking in the workplace| it does little to improve base salary. This of course is compensated with healthy benefits and travel opportunities| but not everyone gets to travel as much.Females beware - an unspoken rule of Japanese companies: female employees always seem to lag behind male counterparts| even to this date. If Sabine Schmitz joined Toyota| she would be serving coffee for her Japanese bosses than testing the LFA in the Nurburgring.Low levels of talent retention - some of the top brains of the company have left due to a seemingly Japanese corporate practice: promotion linked to years of experience in Toyota. Even those who are highly valuable in the Automobile Industry have to spend at least a year or 2 at an undeservingly low position just to learn the Toyota way.Japanese language - some official documents| information is purely in Japanese - therefore leading to communication loss| confusion and mistrust. While English is promoted heavily as the base language| there is still a long way to go before heavy use of Japanese for critical information is prevented. If you know Japanese| this is not an issue at all. ,-3,
