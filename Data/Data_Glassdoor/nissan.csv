They will string you along until you're completely disabled and never get you the proper treatment. They pay a lot more money out trying to keep from paying for proper treatment than to fix the problem. If you think they care about you. .. you really need to think again! I would have retired from there but now I am barely able to walk. I would hear horror stories from other employees when I first started working there but I to was blinded and never believed the stories. I am now a firm believer until it happens to you it's hard to imagine the cruelty and inhumane way Nissan treats you. This company would much rather see their name plastered on football stadiums and music venues than taking care of their employees. Unfortunately Nissan can afford lobbyists and politicians in their back pockets that fight to change work comp laws to their advantage. If you want proof look at all the laws changed in the last five years in Tennessee and see who paid the lobbyists. All I ever wanted was to be healed I didn't want any compensation I just wanted to be able to continue to work. Thanks Nissan for crippling me at the age of thirty three and not caring!! I understand I was just another number to you but I am so much more than that to my family. I am unable to play with my children and enjoy life the way I should but you will never steal my strong will to live!! I may not be able to enjoy a lot of things I once did due to your negligence but I be damned if I will be your victim! For eleven years I gave you my life and as soon as I was injured you wheeled me around to the line knowing you were breaking every Osha violation there was. Your own doctors said I needed surgery asap but you would rather pay a doctor in California who has never seen me before to dispute the other seven doctors you made me go too. Wow what a waste of money!!!. I even tried to pay for treatment on my own but was told by medical and HR that to many people saw me get hurt that they had to be responsible for my treatment! All that being said Nissan is just another corporate monster who could care less about their employees. ,-1,
