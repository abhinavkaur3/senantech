1/5/2017,An Evolving Company with a Positive Outlook,4,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsIt is a great feeling to see your ideas and work come alive on the pavement. I had originally stayed away from OEMs because I didn't feel that they had embraced technology fully enough| but I believe that Ford is making strides to become a technology company in-step with its manufacturing past. Ford has an extremely positive outlook and will continue to become less susceptible to cyclical automotive changes as a mobility company. I am extremely excited for what the future is bringing.,ConsThe vacation policy is really bad when compared to everyone else| and there's no flex time. Come on Ford| it's 2017! We're also forced to use our vacation over the July 4th week - how is that modern thinking?!?!Additionally| everything is done by the book which I believe to be a negative thing. Although there is a conscious effort to change this mentality and to become more agile| there is still a 'Day 2' mentality among many of the veterans as very few of them are thinking outside of the box| This is probably because very few employees have been exposed to many (or any) other work environments. Good thing? Bad thing? It's a double-edged sword - people don't leave because Ford is a great place to be| but it also creates a closed system where ideas can't freely circulate.Lastly| I firmly believe that Ford can become more effective if there was not a fear of business tools. Yes| information is highly sensitive and we don't want information leaks| but Ford seems to hide from new and innovative approaches to managing data and encouraging efficiency. Leadership should push new initiatives for improving business efficiency.,-1,,

The local-hires and the expensive expats are not impacted by this change. I've personally been with the company 6 years and been in the workforce for 12| and this is the single worst thing I have ever witnessed a company do to their employees.

There are only a finite amount of high-rankings to award| so these are awarded to those with 25 years experience and nothing is left for employees under 30.- Working remotely is not a serious option| no one respects it in the culture.- Software used by engineers is extraordinarily outdated. Ford as an organization refuses to outsource any engineering tools| preferring to make and maintain their own versions.- Case in point AVBOM: a tool designed to improve a legacy DOS screen (that somehow still gets used everyday...)| instead of being a sensible software tool| is a visual basic macro-filled excel spreadsheet that works more slowly than DOS itself. All engineers must use this single tool for part number management everywhere in the company| despite its errors and limitations.,-4,,

Toyota somehow is the number 1...Example| ""let's reduce the weight of the gas tank as much as we can| like paper wall| so that it costs next to nothing to manufacture""| ""let's add a four-figure dollar software feature that nobody uses but looks cool"".No clear strategy on how to top Tesla in the EV world.

29/5/2016,Ford is a great place to work.,5,Current Employee - Auto Assembly,ProsThe pay and the benefits are good. I am eligible for overtime pay and yearly profit sharing. We also get quite a few holidays off.,ConsThe work can sometimes be boring and mundane. However| I am eligible to bid on other jobs. Most of the people are nice to work with| however| once in a while I cross paths with a goofball.,0,,
8/6/2016,Research Scientist,3,Current Employee - Research Scientist,"ProsIn research| you're surrounded by very talented peers. There's a strong management push for collaboration| so even if people on the ground aren't keen| you can always fall back on ""One Ford"" and find the right person to connect with. research engineers are also paid pretty well| and benefit options are good. Lots of lower managers are accommodating of new ideas| at least in research.",ConsThe biggest con is that most of us have no career prospects. No one ever gets promoted into management| period. There's been a flurry of activity the last few months| but it's all targeted at pet projects or the current hot area| and it's mostly upper management shuffles. No one from the general salaried ranks is getting promoted into even the lowest level of leadership. we're all fairly well-paid but depressed about how we're going nowhere. but we've got families to support| and benefits are good| so what are our options? it's a running joke between most employees| but no one is laughing.Ford likes to tout all the career resources it provides| like online training| assessments| etc| but at the end of the day| it doesn't matter if you have no actual career prospects. and i'd say 85% of employees have accepted that they will never be promoted out of General Salary| not even after 30 years of service.Also| purchasing is cumbersome. You can't buy anything without going through like 4 layers of management. Buyers will overrule your own order and re-source your request so you end up with a lesser or incompatible item. People buy inferior things or make shady repairs all the time because there's never any approved budget to buy the right tools.,-2,,

It was too much to take in in one day plus we werent allowed to stop for a break for the whole day and I was forced to reverse the van around customer cars and sale cars when I had never drove a van before. I couldnt remember all the routes as the satnav never took you directly to the dealership so I got lost. I didnt have enough training to be able to go it alone after one day when I'd never done delivery driving before!,-1,,

Diverse cultural workforce trying to deliver what is asked of them by the company.,ConsCompany has absolutely zero consideration for work life balance| resulting in numerous family / marital breakups. Employees are often lost in the corporate web of power struggles between egotistic management who have no respect for the workforce around them. Having worked around the globe for FMC for 24 years plus I can and will suggest that anyone thinking of taking up employment with Ford must be prepared for a rough ride - Think twice before you take up employment with Ford.,-2,,

12/12/2015,A reliable second choice,2,Current Employee - Embedded Controls,ProsThe pros of the company are that:1) You get some excellent work life balance| and in the PD engineering area you only really need to be in at work between 9 and 3. There is time where you have to work hard| but it's usually followed by long periods of downtime.2) At the moment it's reliable| you may not be working on the most current technology but we're definitely a sustainable company.3) If you get a good boss or group| you could stay there for a while and there are some good bosses/groups.4) If you have a family| this is a great place to work since you'll be getting out at 4:30 almost every day.,Cons1) Poor leadership in some areas of the company| which leads to frustrating decisions.2) Everyone there is old| the last statistic I heard is that <15% of the company is made up of people under 35 years old (speaking from the Engineering side). And that translates to the culture you experience. If you think you're going to be here working on something cutting edge| or getting experience that will give you to another company you will not get it.3) No career progression past the 5 year mark unless you're a marked person.

7/7/2015,No salary- Pay isn't consistent for salesmen.,3,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsGreat health & dental insurance. You get what you put out. Money is based off of your effort.,ConsSalesmen only make commission- Therefore| a slow season means no money for salesmen. This may not be an issue for dealerships in high traffic areas...but for more rural locations| a slow season can be lethal. Example: January and February are the worst. Everyone spends too much during Christmas| therefore no one is looking to buy a car right after the holidays. No one coming into the dealership means salesman aren't getting paychecks. The salesman who have enough clientele from years of working there might have a few 'repeat customers' come in to buy from them| but usually a slow season is bad for everyone. Also| the dealership doesn't drug test (at least the one I work at) they say they 'might' in the paperwork but they never do. This is a big problem when you out know management is doing drugs on the premises. Management at my particular dealership is crooked... That's not every dealership though. If sales stayed more consistent| I would have no reason to leave. But with a second child on the way| I need more consistency for my family... And this particular dealership doesn't pull in enough money for me to take care of my family properly.,0,,

These settings can be a somewhat of a 'buzz-kill' and inhibit creative and innovative thinking the business wants.Although the executive leadership team is pushing for greater transparency| openness| and acceptance doing things differently| many middle manager are still stuck in there conservative habits of formality and non-transparency.

Do not expect you can put in new ideas and innovate at Ford.Management is very crappy. Projects are shuffled every 6 months| so you got to hand over and take over new projects.

After being placed in a work environment that was filled with several ""Good Old Boys"" who all had an unbelievable hatred for anyone with a different sexual orientation| that team worked very hard to make my life as miserable as they could during my term with them| including stealing from me| tampering with meals that I brought to work| openly making hateful jokes and remarks about gay people| and making repeated efforts to get me terminated. Well| finally after I was struck by an individual with a large ""Mag"" flashlight| and because I simply pushed him away from me in an attempt to prevent any additional strikes to me| my career was stolen from me| and my life has been ruined as a result. Not only were the ""Good Old Boys"" active in the efforts to rob me of my career and future| but every supervisor that was in charge of my work area worked closely with them in their efforts. It took them about four years to achieve their goal| after all| my work record was exemplary| and only after defending my personal safety were they able to finally find success for their efforts| the local UAW| and my committee man would do nothing to correct the gross injustice that was done to me. I can tell you that| although Ford Motor Company makes claims that they value diversity| and work to create an all inclusive work environment| the fact is that on the ""shop floor""| there is no real effort to attain an all-inclusive| non-discriminatory workplace. Keep your eyes open| a book to detail my journey may be coming.",-4,,

You can truly see and understand your impact to the company's bottom line.,ConsNo real recognition for extraordinary efforts| it's treated as the expectation| so it's very difficult to be seen as a high achiever. Very limited lines for promotion. Constantly move from launch to launch without any real downtime| so your usually under constant stress,0,,
16/3/2015,A rewarding career that offered a rich mix of functional and global experience.,5,Current Employee - Chief Engineer,ProsGlobal company that puts many employees into daily interaction with other employees around the world. As a family controlled company| there is a very strong sense of community/family around the world.,ConsWorking global is harder due to time zones and differing cultural norms.

18/3/2015,in 20 years I have moved 3 departments| Have done an Apprenticeship| always meeting new people and making new friends.,5,Current Employee - Mechanical and Electrical Engineer,ProsI started in September 1994 and although ford have closed departments down such as the parts assembly and the press shop| every effort has been made to accommodate anybody wishing to remain with the company| including training or re-skilling to ease the transition.Ford has never made compulsory redundancies| but makes redundancy/retirement packages far greater than legally required to do which means at the time you part the company you can expect to be able to live comfortable in your retirement. The factory has a friendly atmosphere and there are plenty of opportunities for growth in all departments. The rate of pay is far better than most companies within the area and there is overtime to make a little extra. Employee discount on cars and from local retailers and membership to a sports and social club with a monthly lottery to win a car or money.,ConsThe company struggles to standardise procedures across all plants and departments and in some cases has a very outdated work ethic and still has far to much paperwork that could be done on a computer instead of printing it all out.Lots of areas that used to be undertaken by ford have been tendered out to contractors.,0,,

I work in product development on advanced powertrain designs| and the middle management is very hard-working| relatively visionary| and sensible.

Mgmt in my organization is open-minded to feedback and suggestions on how to improve procedures| designs| etc.","ConsCost drives every decision and many times seems to be the only factor when selecting components/designs. Product strategists can often be obtuse about advanced technology/ideas and squelch creativity| despite the executive management's stated commitments to innovation... it seems they want to be the first company to offer exciting new features (e.g.| SYNC| aluminum F150| etc)| but internally it seems many of strategists consider features only after the competition offers them... which resembles a ""follower"" attitude| not that of a leader.",0,,

Also Ford encourages its employees to telecommute once a week typically Friday| but it isn't required.,ConsUnless you live in Dearborn| the commute to work is pretty bad| traffic on Southfield (M39) or 94 is pretty bad. I wish there were better cafeteria options for Food| usually you have to go out to eat if you don't pack| but one of the best Thai restaurants in the Metro Detroit area is 10 min from Ford's campus. Parking can be an issue if you work at EVB,-4,,

They outsource all the pieces and then outsource someone else to put all the pieces together. If you want to actually create something| might as well go to a Tier 1- Ford counts the arbitrary bonus as part of your ""salary"" even though it could change by thousands of dollars in a single year. They use the bonus as an excuse to offer lower salaries. A bonus is supposed to be a BONUS.- Ford is constantly brainwashing employees during their mandatory trainings| orientations and ""all-hands"" calls. It seriously felt like I was in a cult worshiping the great Lord Ford.- Ford tried to steal my bonus. They literally stole the money from my bank account after I left the company even though I was eligible for the bonus and worked extremely hard to earn it.",-10,,

22/2/2015,Great benefits and pay but not as easy as you think.,3,Current Employee - Technician,ProsGreat pay and benefits. We build some of the best and most advanced front wheel drive transmissions in the world. You work with a variety of technology including| Stamping presses| automated milling machinery| assembly equipment and modernized assembly lines. Almost all of the plant is climate controlled and has air quality levels above those in many production facilities.Ford provides great health and dental benefits as well as educational benefits for college and self improvement purposes. Use them to keep your mind sharp and life interesting.,ConsLittle room to climb in the company. Long hours due to a variety of modern scheduling programs. Every department has different scheduling systems which do not coincide. Creates animosity| absenteeism| and competition to get in to specific departments. Very little overtime due to scheduling. Due to Tier Two systems and plant closures high seniority from other locations have come| some paid| to this plant| forcing the majority of original Van Dyke employees to undesired shifts. Unless you have 20 years plus| you won't get to pick your shift. Under 15 years and you'll more than likely be stuck on afternoon shift until you retire. Due to UAW wording in contract you won't be able to transfer to other plants unless their is a permanent layoff or your plant becomes designated a Tier Two facility.,-1,,

Ford has a less number of salaried employees than GM. But| Ford distributes to salaried employees half the annual bonuses GM distributes to salaried employees. Ford is a stingy company. Ford is generous only to UAW and upper managements. That is why only average Joe engineers stay at Ford.,-10,,
24/2/2015,Outdated Office and Union Oriented Company,1,Current Employee - Closure Engineer,ProsIf you are a line assembly worker| this is the best company to work for in auto industry because their hourly rate| $58| is the industry best.,ConsIf you are a salaried employee| this is the worst company to work for in auto industry because your benefits and compensations will be the worst in the same industry.

Products are exciting.,ConsPay isn't extremely compelling compared to others| often times different divisions silo tasks| way too many meetings| large lack of task accountability when it comes to next step so more meetings get created| because a lot of the engineering is supplier-based there is less hands-on engineering in product development BUT it is present in research and launch duties.,-1,,
18/2/2015,High health insurance cost is killing me....,1,Current Employee - Product Development Engineer,ProsEvery year health insurance premium and deductible go up 10 times faster than my salary increase.

There's a lot of respect for top management within the organization.,"ConsI understand why Ford has the rules they have in place for contractors| but the end result is that the contractor is treated with suspicion - although it's better on some teams than others. Also| contractors are not paid any more than Ford employees even though they receive none of the benefits that Ford employees do even though they are doing the same job. It's nearly impossible to get a raise because Ford considers contractors as ""hired guns"" who are hired to do a single job. The reality is that no one there does only what they were hired to do. Management ignores the fact that contractors take on other roles| outside their original responsibility| and should be paid more for it.",-4,,

After you pay high health insurance premiums and deductibles| your take-home money shrinks a lot.,-29,,
19/1/2015,Very Poor Management,1,Current Employee - Software Engineer,ProsYou get some discounts when you buy Ford cars| but some people buy Ford cars cheaper even without employee discounts.,ConsThe company think they provide competitive benefits to employees| but some employees know they are not because their spouses work for competitors. The company advertises like employees are very satisfied| but many of my coworkers don't agree. First| they highly regard line-workers (UAW) than competitors| but hard-working regular salaried employees are treated with a drop-in-a-bucket annual bonuses. Second| their employee discounts are laughable. My friend who is not a Ford employee can buy a Ford car for cheaper price. Third| employees' vacation days are one week less than the competitor in Warren| MI.

11/12/2014,Low-quality engineers and treats people like children,2,Current Employee - Software Engineer,ProsFord offers employees the ability to rotate into other parts of the business (and even requires this for college graduates). They offer tuition assistance| a patent rewards program and some unique benefits (ie. use of Ford lawyers for certain personal cases).,"ConsLeadership seems to be a huge problem within my organization. Nobody wants to take charge to make a product truly excellent| people just want to coast by without doing any hard work. A week stuck in meetings is a successful week to a lot of these people| even if no quantifiable work gets done after all the meetings.Ford treats employees like children. Employees have to go to mandatory hour-long ""trainings"" that basically tell you not to post confidential material on social networks and not to accept bribes from customers. IT sends out emails like ""Cyber Steve learns about safe Web browsing"" with a picture of a little cartoon IT guy telling you to use a secure password. It's insulting to be a professional engineer and having people treat you like a child.Another big problem is Ford promotes peopled based on how long you've been with the company instead of the quality of your work. This leads to| for example| an IT employee being promoted to supervisor of a production software team just because he's been at Ford the longest. These are just two different worlds and they don't mesh well together| which is why some of these production products are a disaster. People should be promoted based on the quality of their work| not for how many years they can sit behind the same desk.I have yet to meet someone at Ford who understands the difference between good software and bad software. People seem to think that if ""it works"" then it's good software and the project is good to ship. No! That is absolutely wrong! Just because the software works in a black-box test environment doesn't mean it's robust| readable| flexible or maintainable. Some of the software I've seen has been an absolute nightmare and my superiors refuse to let me make it any better because ""it already works"". Come back to me in 5 years when you have to make a change that becomes impossible to implement and tell me ""it works"".",-17,,
30/12/2014,Internship at Ford Motor Company,3,Former Employee - Software Engineer,ProsVery friendly environment. Great team to work with.

11/12/2014,Pretty Amazing Place,5,Current Employee - Ford College Graduate,ProsFord is awesome. Every day I am surrounded by engineers who put in a lot of work and effort to make sure the best they can do is going into their work. Work hours are very flexible| lots of autonomy| there is no micromanaging at all. Managers/ supervisors are so approachable and willing to help its ridiculous ( I am a new hire and know a few higher level managers and can email them or instant message them anytime and they always respond and are very helpful). Pay is competitive| benefits are good. It's a very big company| so work/life balance fluctuates depending where you go| but for the most part I'd say its pretty good. Plenty of opportunities to travel all over the world| I was almost sent to Spain for 2 weeks within my first 4 months of working. Ford gives you from a little before Christmas to a couple days after new years off as part of just holiday time off| not part of your vacation. So this is an additional like 2 weeks of paid vacation| on top of your vacation days (HUGE pro). Its an awesome place to work| I have been very pleased.,ConsMichigan is gorgeous in the summer| but is a very gloomy cold place in the winter. If you don't like the cold or are not used to it| this is a big con. Detroit isn't as bad as most people think| but there are some sketchy areas (some incredible ones too). In some departments (crash and safety engineering for instance) work/life balance is not good. For most people| during 4th of July you are forced to use 4 vacation days.. this sucks because you only get 10 your fist couple of years. Facilities where you work are very dated and ugly. Makes for kind of a gloomy environment. There are a lot of cons that you will get just because Ford is so huge| like dealing with IT| that will be the same pretty much any time you work for a big company though| lots of communication hold-ups and delays.,0,,

28/10/2014,A very well structured that could stand to loosen up a bit,4,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,"ProsFord is a global company which can allow for a great variance in experience there. Management is generally well-guided and moves with purpose| and the lower management staff are very well trained in supporting their direct reports.Compensation is fair| although promotions can be tough to acquire if you're not good at being memorable and likeable. Benefits are pretty good| but not outstanding.While there's a great push for work/life balance (relaxed dress code| alternate work schedules| very few supervisors ""watch the clock"" for your coming and going| etc)| it's clear that the higher you go up the food chain| the more you're expected to give up.",ConsWhile each department runs like a well-oiled machine in most regards| cross-department interaction can be tenuous. Everyone is very disciplined in their skill-set| but the various processes and structures don't mesh well in other areas. This creates confusion| gaps in timing and understanding| and animosity among some players. It doesn't help that upper management| at least from an IT perspective| doesn't seem to be willing to push too hard to help remedy these problems.,-1,,

I am told by many it is one of the most difficult.,"ConsUAW protects employees who need it (do not do their jobs). Some of upper management can not or will not back the process coach in debate against the UAW. Most union operators and Trades are very unmotivated and if the Process Coach pushes them to work they will find a way to do less and then report the Process Coach to labor relation for offensive behavior. So for example if upper management sends the command that all operators must clean their operations then Process Coach goes to all Operators and says ""please clean your area better before the end of shift"" the operators get together and decide they will all go to labor relations at separate times and report offensive language or aggressive behavior on the process coach| who is then disciplined.The process coach training does not cover much of the actual difficulties of the position.If the operators want overtime they can and will find a way to stall production so weekend production is scheduled. Weekend production is only an issue because the Process Coach is only paid their base pay no 1 1/2 or double time for mandatory overtime. Managers are known to schedule meetings before or after start of shifts requiring employees to work unpaid over time every day.Salary are required to present projects they have never seen before because they are not involved in the projects. Due to the tremendous amount of work load they have they do not have time to work on projects| leadership knows this but it is easier to force an unfinished report so the presenter looks unprepared.",-7,,

24/8/2014,Hope for the future if politics are in check,2,Current Employee - Communications Manager,ProsThere's plenty of room to push yourself and find opportunities to grow with corporate jobs @ FMC. Within HQ| people are often moved around... one can continue to advance knowledge and skills. Some senior leaders - like Joe Hinrichs| Kumar Galhotra| and even new CEO Mark Fields - are sometimes willing to take smart risks to drive the company forward as the world continues to change. People are paid well for their work. Benefits are solid. Working for a Fortune 10 company is always good on a resume.,"ConsThe politics| especially on the communications team| are unbelievable. Half of your time will be spent walking on eggshells as not to upset anyone and to stay on the good side of a few management team members so you can actually accomplish anything. The company claims to have a creative mindset where ideas are welcome| but that only applies to those ""in"" with senior leaders| who may turn on you quickly. People here learn to be experts on what leadership wants| not experts on social media or PR| which means there is a lack of creative| groundbreaking work. Teamwork is not encouraged or celebrated. Mentoring is actually discouraged. Turnover rate on this team was extraordinarily high while I was there - 1-2 people/month on average for the last few years.",-5,,

You have to work 12 hours to get paid for 10. The schedule dictates that you work those hours| but they won't pay you for all of your time. If you work 11 hours| you get no overtime. Telecommuting is viewed as a negative| if it is even permitted at all. You are held hostage in your current position. The only way to be allowed to try something new is if you basically burn your bridges. They have this thing called the ""One Ford Behaviors"" (available online if you search it) that would be great if they were followed and interpreted correctly. Data is not used to make decisions. Standard processes are not followed. Being a team player is one of the behaviors| but if you follow most of the other expected behaviors| you are labeled as not being a team player. If you stand up for what is right| you are judged as not working well with others. Status quo is preferred over continuous improvement.",-4,,

The team concept is always promoting quality control in order to produce the highest level of product possible.,ConsBecause of the changing work environment| a two-tiered pay structure was implemented a few years ago.

On average I have had to relocate every 18 to 24 months. The relocation package is not competitive and employees have to bear a lot of the expense. Promotions seem to be based on managing up and not based on merit. Pretty boys and girls seem to get ahead even when they don't do their jobs well. It's all about the politics.

Regardless of what you may hear from the corporate officers| this company is firmly rooted in the 1970s. Day-to-day operations are sloppy and unprofessional. Improvements are nearly impossible because there is so much political infighting. You can try to get a promotion| but you will still be in or near Detroit.

29/4/2014,Very good employer,4,Current Employee - Infrastructure Architect,ProsFord does a good job of hiring knowledgable people in all areas| and a very good job of only promoting the best to middle- and upper-level management positions. I have yet to run into a middle level manager (above supervisor) who I couldn't learn from. That doesn't mean they all have great technical knowledge| but they can't possibly always know technical details of projects given that they are usually dealing with budgets and people issues.,ConsProcesses.... then more processes.

Depending on the organization you work for| there is a high degree of flexibility in work hours and the option to telecommute on occasion.,ConsBe warned| if you come to Ford after you turn 40| it is unlikely you will ever be promoted or have any other developmental or advancement opportunities. Your career is essentially over. They imply that if you come to work for them (usually with a pay cut from your previous position)| you will eventually get back to your present level of income and responsibility. They are not being truthful. This is especially true in the GSR (non-managerial) ranks. People come to work for a company for many reasons. If you want to work a reasonable 45-50 hrs./week with few weekends in a job that is less challenging than the one you have| Ford is the place for you. If you are over 40 and still have the drive| energy| and ambition to get ahead| you should treat employment at Ford as a transitional assignment until you can find a better job.,-7,,

Management has the option to lease vehicles with unlimited mileage and includes insurance. The only other thing I can think of is that they allow you to telecommute one or two days a week and provide alternative work weeks such as 4 10 hour days with a day off.,ConsVery political.

25/9/2013,Thoughts on the FCG Program,3,Former Employee - FCG Program - Several Positions,ProsFCG (Ford College Graduate) Program allows you to get hired from college and get great insight into the company by trying out 3 yearly positions (rotations). You get to try out positions you pick. You may pick almost anything you want| but with some controls. i.e. not all Ford positions are available. Only those whose manager is open to having an FCG work for them. Also| if two or more people vie for one position| only one of those people gets it. The rest go with their 2nd| 3rd| or 4th choices.FCG Program gives you a way to evaluate Ford and for Ford to evaluate you. FCG Program allows this to happen much faster than if you were hired directly into Ford outside of the FCG program. The Program also gives you opportunities to move fields on a whim| where otherwise you would more likely stay in your general chosen area.,"ConsFCG program is there to try things at Ford| but one can potentially overshoot themselves and fail. i.e. it is possible to select a position you are not qualified for and currently there are no controls to avoid that situation. This is on purpose. You get to try things at Ford| you pick the positions| and it feels like you are in control.But you need to be mindful that while you are selecting and working your positions| Ford management and HR watch your performance levels and if they drop too low| may take action. HR trumps FCG Program.That means you cannot truly ""try a position"". You need to use care in selecting your rotations and you need to be able to do the job well| or else you may find yourself being released from the program and back into the wild. FCG advisors will guide you| but they will not always caution you on your selection| or be able to help you when things get really tough.Not all rotations end up being the way they were stated on paper. For example| a highly technical role may end up being doing research on a software package and putting together a software configuration document. Or a technical developer role where you expect to write code may end up being a usability analyst where you do research instead.A lot of roles are ambiguous| because Ford work is ambiguous. There is lots of overhead -meetings & paperwork| to figure out what to do| and things change| so it is natural that some positions end up not matching their written description by the time you get to them. Sometimes roles change as you are working them| and you may find your position description change quite a bit. In the same vein| being a large company| Ford management moves around. Sometimes you find that managers change or leave| as you get to your position| but that is more rare.",-6,,

12/9/2013,Excellent people and products; Ford has been the best employer of my career.,5,Former Employee - Engineering Technical Specialist,ProsFord consciously develops and well compensates its people. The leadership| especially the engineering leadership| is second to none. The product development process is world class and continuously being refined. The finance and marketing teams are incredibly bright and always have a seat at the table. As an employee| I felt valued.

10/9/2013,Strong company with great focus for the future,5,Former Employee - Engineer Intern,ProsThere is a great sense of pride about working at Ford. I have never worked for a company where the people cared so much for the products they make. There is a great sense of accomplishment because you get to work on a product people love. Also| I have never worked for a company where people respected their CEO as much as Ford employees respect Alan Mulally. He is a great leader and a genuine person who has done a tremendous job at bringing Ford back to being a market leader.,ConsAs with working with any large corporation there can be a lot of hoops to jump through. In particular if you need anything done by IT you have submit a work ticket and then wait forever for it to actually get done (if it does not get lost). Or you have to call and pester someone to get it done quicker.,0,,

My employment has been consistent with very little down time| even during our economic woes.

Good company to have on your resume as a Fortune 10 company. Also good experience working with the 6-Sigma methodology,ConsPolitics| politics| politics. Since mass layoffs occurred in 2009 and again in 2011| opportunities have declined. We are operating at the same sales/receivable level with 2/3 of the former staff --- longer hours| more responsibility. Why a company that requires workers to work 60 hours a week to complete their job functions thinks they can cut staff by 2/3 and still remain sucessfull is beyond me. If you work hard and are a top performer| don't expect to get promoted --- that goes to the people who know the right managers. Seen plenty of people promoted to the top echelons just based on superficial attitudes and low quality work. This is not my personal complaint| this is discussed every day with coworkers from throughout the company.,-3,,

23/7/2013,The Company has changed.......,3,Former Employee - Senior Manager,ProsThe business has recovered and the environment is stable. Initial salaries are competitive and bonus and profit sharing is good.,"ConsFord has refused to staff up to the levels needed to support the business. It is almost abusive the amount of work that is placed on employees at all levels of the organization. When a large number of the senior leadership team left during the downsizing in 2009| the culture of the Company did not transition to the new leaders. The leadership team is focused on the success of the business at the expense of the workforce. The Company is making large profits but employees are still purchasing their own stationary supplies due to the level of approval required to purchase pens and paper. Also| the compensation programs will force early career people to leave after only a few years if they hope to grow their salary. With only a 2.7% merit increase in most years| someone would have to leave the company to keep their salary growing in hopes of building enough personal wealth to retire someday. ""Fire me I need the raise"" can not be more true. Continues to be a very conservative company that manages by committee so that no one manager is accountable.....very difficult to get things done.",-1,,

The company now has great products and offers opportunities to learn about them first hand.,ConsCareer advancement is slow and dis highly dependent upon your management's willingness to fight for you.

The training program can use some work. There is still an old-Ford mentality that lingers| despite Mulally's One Ford plan to transform the culture.

I leave the judgement to you !Forget about career advancement through research: the technical tracks for growth are all blocked and eliminated back in 2008-2009 lay offs.

11/4/2012,Not a place for anybody with talent or ambition,2,Former Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsI learned a lot about technique| etiquette| and how a big company works. The company's name is recognized across the world| and somewhat well-respected. Benefits were good and salary was good enough. There was strong communication from senior executives| and they seemed capable| for the most part. Some of my co-workers were kind and honest.,"ConsMy opinion was rarely valued or considered. The ""boss is always right"" mentality is pervasive| and you will be punished if you don't subscribe to it.The company does a very poor job at developing its employees. This comes from someone who was in the CFP (Career Foundation Program)| supposedly a development program for recent college graduates. For one| if you work at an auto plant outside Detroit| you basically aren't in the CFP: mentoring circles| speakers| etc.| are unavailable to you. In my two years at the company| not a single person from the program talked to me individually--not to ask how I was doing or what direction I wanted to take my career. ""CFP"" is mostly just a title--it doesn't mean you're on the fast track to anything| or in any way elite. When I told the program manager I was leaving the company| he basically said ""okay""| and didn't even ask why.The performance review system is broken and unfair. Unless you can walk on water| you get the same rating as everybody else: ""Achiever"". My boss essentially told me that I had done about everything I possibly could have to reach ""Top Achiever""| but only a certain percentage of the company's employees can be ""Top Achievers""| and some people essentially were entitled to that rating after so many years receiving it| and the Production guys tended to support each other| rather than Finance| at the meeting where ratings are decided. Among the widely varying levels of performance in my department| it's a safe bet that everybody was an ""Achiever"". Why put in effort when you'll just get the same ranking as everybody else no matter what you do?Promotion opportunities are non-existent. Expect to work 10 years at the company before being promoted.Ford is bureaucratic| political| and parochial. I often felt like the main competitor was the other departments at Ford| not the other auto companies. My department frequently fiddled with financial reporting to produce a desired result. Internally| financial reporting was a political football.People could be brutal to each other at the plant. It was common for the Plant Manager and LMM to dress down their subordinates in meetings; I think this was considered form of motivation. I myself was shouted at and borderline-harassed in meetings| especially when I was new| and I was still treated lightly by comparison.I ran into many people who had worked for Ford for years| who didn't want to change and didn't see the big picture. At Ford| you're supposed to shut up| do your work| and not ask questions.Do they wonder why the good employees leave?",-4,,

Management is afraid of making bad mistakes therefore they dodge decisions and melt down during every minor crisis. They tend to be too passive and reactionary rather than proactive. They also do a terrible job giving recognition to their employees for doing a good job. Furthermore| Ford has nearly 30 layers of management - Toyota has 8 layers of management. Ford wastes money rewarding executives for the title on their business card rather than on actual production (aka - retention bonuses). Toyota only pays executive bonuses when they make profit goals. Another problem is that many of the ford supervisors work for outside companies. They do not care about Ford. They are only collecting a check.,0,,

20/6/2010,Working for Ford is submitting to a life that is mediocre and uninspiring. Some people don't mind that; I do.,2,Current Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsGenerally good work life balance. However| it depends on the organization you are in. The company is doing well for a US automaker. Good name recognition on a resume. You start in a rotational program| so you get to move to a different area every 18 months. They also will pay for part-time MBA programs| but you are required to work at Ford for 2 years after completing that.,ConsLiving in Michigan is the number one downside for me. If you can get past that| another downside is that there is little opportunity for career advancement. The company is still far too top heavy and moving from Analyst to Supervisor is not easy and generally takes an MBA and 8+ years. There are many people who work at Ford who are basically incompetent and getting paid $90K+ year. They have been there forever| are still Analysts and will never become Supervisors. It is frustrating working with these people knowing how much more they are getting paid and how much worse they are at their job than me. Ford and Michigan are very uninspiring places to work.,-7,,

If you're a mid-career manager| you will find that your outside experience is needed and appreciated. Unfortunately| Ford prefers to promote early career employees. If you come to Ford mid-career| do a good job| but remember that the level and job that you entered will more than likely be the same that you have when you exit.,0,,

It offers flexible working schedule. The diversity is good.,ConsToo big to move in one direction or another. There are still mediocre people around even after waves of job cuts and buyouts. It is too nice to women. I wish I were a female engineer. Managements generally have lower expectation to female workers. But for diversity's sake| they have to keep them even they don't do much.

25/1/2010,Campus Intern,4,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,"ProsThe internship was a great experience because it related directly to my marketing major. I had to organize events and promote the Ford Brand in the most ""college friendly"" way. I was able to host events with other organizations on campus and get paid while doing so.",ConsThe only downside was I had to spend a lot of time creating event ideas| making budgets| preparing promotional material and updating our websites.

13/1/2010,Decent place to work,4,Current Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsGood work life balance and decent pay.,ConsIf you are a top performer this probably isn't best place for you since most promotions are based on connections rather than performance.,-1,,
8/1/2010,Okay but not great for high performers,4,Current Employee - Marketing,ProsThe pay is decent if not great for Michigan. Most employees are quite loyal and invested for the long term. Most employees are fairly good at what they do. Management among the top C level managers is great and consistent. Good product strategy (currently). Alan Mulally saved the company.,ConsMiddle and lower level managers are hit or miss. They can be completely terrible. There is absolutely no leadership| no accountability| and no consistency with these lower level managers. Ford pretty much wants you to get married and get a house and family so that you don't consider leaving. Once you are in it is almost impossible to get fired so you have to deal with low performers a lot. Promotions are based 100% off years of service as opposed to performance. Communication across groups such as digital marketing is non-existent. Managers can be eager to hear about concerns but will do almost nothing to find a solution. What may take 2 months to do at a small or mid sized company will take at least a year at Ford. Shifting priorities. Micromanagement is terrible and there is absolutely no checks or balances on it. There is no opportunity to move around in your job or advance because the company is not growing.,-2,,
13/1/2010,Works you hard| but can be rewarding!,4,Current Employee - Project Development Engineer,ProsDespite being over 100 years old| Ford is an up and coming automaker with a bright future. Its really nice to (finally) receive all the positive press and gain respect relative to peers in the industry. The executive management team is talented| bold| and willing to make difficult decisions. The strategy set forth from Alan's team is clear and spot-on - profitable growth from a global product-led revolution. And the top management really make an effort to inform employees about certain topics regarding the company which would not normally be known. The company offers very competitive benefits and salary| and have policies in place for very flexible work schedules and arrangements to help support work-life integration.,ConsHours can be long. The consecutive years of rightsizing the company have cut the employee base to the bare minimum necessary to operate. Thus we're all working very hard. Some middle management at the company needs improvement - especially related to lack of leadership. Sometimes it seems they want to pass the buck to the upper management and let them decide everything. Also promotions have been rare recently| and probably will be for the near future| so career development is stalled.,0,,
23/1/2010,Ford Motor Company Internship,3,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,Pros-Valuable experience and the ability to work independently-Good pay compared to other companies in the same area and industry,Cons-Poorly managed-Office morale is lower at Ford than at any other Company I have worked for-They were in the midst of restructuring and roles were not clear,0,,

I developed trusting relationships with those in my department and others within my first few months of working here. Most people at all levels truly care about one another's success. Ford Motor Company leads the rebound of the automotive industry| and it's exciting to have a role in the turn-around.,"ConsRecent economic pressure has led some employees to fear for their jobs. When people are driven by fear| political jockeying and sharp elbows prevail. Some lower and mid level managers have adapted to having smaller teams by digging in and working alongside those who report to them| while others still feel it is only their job to ""manage"" and babysit| not to contribute in any meaningful way. Ford is still quite management heavy| leaving little opportunity for promotions or growth opportunities.",-1,,
27/12/2009,Live and kicking,4,Current Employee - IT Manager,ProsEvery day brings new challenges. This allows one to grow professionally in ways that are not possible in companies that are in steady state.

3/11/2009,Not bad for a big| old-line manufacturing company,4,Former Employee - IT Manager (LL6),ProsThe size and scope of Ford ensures that you can get a broad experience in a number of areas. Ford strongly believes in rotations| so you will see many aspects of the business. They are also very strong believers in work-life balance.In IT| you will have the opportunity to work with just about every platform imaginable| on a scale found few other places. Ford still does almost all of its IT internally| so very little is outsourced. Information Security is an especially strong area of Ford IT.,ConsAs with most large companies| things move slowly. Because many employees have been there for decades| new ideas have real difficulty penetrating. Recent changes in management have dramatically improved this| and Alan Mulally is creating a culture of change| but this culture has not made it to IT| where old rules still apply.,0,,

3/11/2009,Not A Bad Place To Work| But It's Not For Everyone,3,Current Employee - Production Supervisor,ProsIn addition to offering competitive salary and benefits| Ford offers a professional experience unlike any other you will find. If you work in Vehicle Operations at any facility in the Ford system| you are exposed to a very fast-paced environment that maximizes your ability to multi-task and to make decisions on both inductive and deductive reasoning. Your leadership skills and fortitude will be constantly tested.Because the company annually ranks in Fortune's top 20 companies| Ford's size and scale makes your resume stand out to prospective employers.,ConsThe constant tension of dealing in a union environment can be debilitating. If you are a creative professional| you may find yourself consistently stifled by the framework of the labor agreement and the overall environment in which you work. In summary| Ford offers challenges that do not necessarily require a technical expertise or advanced degree in order to excel. Just thick skin and a willingness to endure an onslaught of repetitive| banal tasks.Also| because auto is a mature industry and Ford has been in business for over 100 years| growth is limited. Promotional opportunities are limited thanks to several years of salary staff reductions and those that remain are holding firm to their jobs in the tough economy. However| if you are afforded the opportunity to accept an assignment that takes you to Dearborn| you have to ask yourself if you really want to spend any portion of your career in Detroit.,0,,

9/9/2009,FORD EMPLOYMENT,3,Current Employee - Engineer - GSR 7,ProsThe company respects and provides great deal of freedom to for professional development| diversity and work life balance. The company treats employees with respect and dignity even under some most trying circumstances.,ConsThe company is slow to adapt changes and slow to recognize and reward innovations. Technical and subject matter expertise can only take you so far in the organizational hierarchy after which it becomes all-managment or process leadership which is unfortunate.,0,,
4/8/2009,Solid Internship Experience| Some Communications Issues,4,Former Employee - Student Programmer,ProsI spent a little over a year doing 20 hrs. per week as a Ford IT supplemental employee (40 hrs. per week between May and August of 2008)| as part of a college student employment initiative by Ford's IT function. In accordance with my skill set| I primarily worked on internal web-based application development. Overall| I appreciate the experience I was able to gain there| although like most IT jobs| the position had its trials and tribulations.The two supervisors at the Houghton office are great to work with and the manager is very flexible about scheduling. Assigned projects are based on experience and skill set| though almost all work is grounded in either Java or C++| with any database and/or web design knowledge being a big plus. Pay was very good compared to most other opportunities in the area| and there were even a few fringe benefits as a mere supplemental employee.,ConsCommunication with the rest of my project teams in Dearborn was sometimes a struggle. Getting everyone together for a phone or video conference was tough| so e-mail and word-of-mouth were heavily relied upon| occasionally resulting in gaps. Most people I was in contact with were cooperative and helpful| though a few strays needed a kick in the pants from their respective supervisors.Ford employs many thickly-accented foreigners| which can sometimes compound communication issues. Patience is simply the key in those situations.Opportunities for significant advancement are unlikely in the short-term| with the auto industry the way it is. Still| I thought Ford was being competently run during my time there| and its revitalized fleet of products should position the company to enjoy any sort of economic turnaround| should one come in the near future.,0,,

The company is focused on executing flawlessly and expects a high level of performance. There is not much dead weight left and everyone takes their work very seriously. The company is making the right product decisions to support a successful future.,ConsThere is too much bureaucracy and it can take a long time to make a decision. The average workload is quite high and while management supports a good work/life balance it can be difficult to manage the expected workload without working extra hours. The chimney approach to managing the different product development organizations is outdated and causes political battles over who owns what.,0,,

1/6/2009,Once upon a time Ford was a career-company. Now| opportunities for advancement are very limited.,3,Current Employee - Product Engineer,ProsPeer employees are helpful.Out-of-college salary initially competitive.Global company with long reach.,ConsVery limited career progression opportunities. Highly silo'ed organizations. No cross functional leadership programs. Not a lot of diversity in management. Lack of tuition assistance and/or other developmental training. Management happy to have high potential employees stay in the same job year after year instead of looking for development opportunities. Given this| many leave the company and those who are left are middle to low performers.,0,,

Also| the new cars are really cool and you get to try them out through the ""drive one"" campaign before they're available to the public! :) We are starting to use the economic crunch to truly eliminated waste.",ConsLack of automotive sales make cost cutting a constant companion. There have been very few promotions in the last 3 years. There is a freeze on raises| no match on 401k contributions and no bonuses in the near future.

Again| I preference this on the economy getting better. This will open up more opportunities.,ConsAlways under pressure| who is going to be let go next. The workloads are beginning to become staggering. The work is transferred to the people who stay and it is still expected to be done. Things are falling through the cracks.It seems training is something of the past. There is no time to train others.The company is so big| you get lost in the suffle and are just another number.

20/4/2009,A good company in the past which is in trouble now.,3,Former Employee - Zone Manager,ProsA somewhat stable domestic auto company. Good leadership. The benefits are more than fair.,ConsThe current economy makes it a very unstable environment in the auto industry as a whole| not only Ford. Also| there are too many managers in the company and even the managers know this and try to trim the vount down. So| I don't think there will be many promotional opportunities in the near future.,0,,

Motivation is pretty much down| especially due to the unexpected downturn of some vehicle development programs due to the credit crisis.Having seen other vehicle OEM's I can say moral was the worst at FORD.Working in an office where almost everyone is a middle-aged male worker doesn't help improving office culture either| other manufactures have a more diverse workforce.,-3,,

It is a global company and can offer the resources of a large corporation.,ConsOftentimes the company is too heirarchical and isn't flexible enough to manage change very efficiently.

6/3/2009,Ford - Fair and Balanced Review,3,Current Employee - Marketing Manager,Pros1) You get a very large amount of responsibility for initiating and executing very large projects and programs. Most manager positions would qualify for senior level management responsibilities in other companies.2) The sales and marketing career track rewards a broad based| generalist knowledge of both the sales and marketing career diciplines. You must be sucessful at both to suceed!3) Managers at Ford are flexible and adaptable| due to a previous culture of being reassigned (promoted based on merit) and the willingness to relocate. Seasoned employees are comfortable with a certain amount of unplanned activity and readily adapt to meet challegenges and support the business.4) Starting out| you will get an opportunity every 2-3 years| to a) learn a new job; b) make a contribution; c) move forward| based on performance. Jumps between starting levels (GSR) are small and very reachable. It is easy to see the next step and work toward that target. You have great managers and coaches to help you.,Cons1) Promotions and professional development are stagnent at mid -senior level (MR| | SC & PSR) levels. The same employess who excelled and survived at the first levels get sent to Dearborn and rot in the same (or similar) job. Promotions are extremely limited.2) The executive level is very difficult to join. There is a ceiling.3) Anyone with an advanced degree should only consider coming to Ford if you can join one of the leadership programs. The company won't reward you or consider you for an executive position otherwise.4) Death by a thousand cuts.... In Dearborn| Ford has cut about 42|000 employess (from c. 60|000)since 2000. They are roughly one-third the size they were eight years ago. However| many of these losses seemed to have been replaced by what appear to be H1B Visa workers. Especially in finance| accounting and IT.,-2,,

5/3/2009,Smart| intelligent co-workers. Great experience and benefits. Limited opportunites for personal growth and development.,3,Former Employee - Marketing Manager,Pros1) The scale of business you manage at mid-management level is humongous| what directors and vice presidents at many other Fortune 500 companies would be handling.2) Some of the smartest folks from the top and second-tier universities that you work with.3) Opportunity to learn about processes required to manage a huge| complex business like the automotive business.4) Opportunity to get schooled in managing the maze of layers and politics for getting something done.,Cons1) Old boys network still prevails - glass ceiling for minorities and women.2) Huge size and complex business has the downside of things moving slowly and decisions being made slowly through the different hierarchical structures.3) Cyclical nature of the automotive business.,-1,,
9/3/2009,Doing a great job staying one step ahead of competition and anticipating pitfalls.,3,Current Employee - Program Manager,ProsThe chance to work on products that affect everyone's lives and unparalleled chances to work one product you will see on the road every day throughout the country. Also the chance to have significant responsibility for major expenditures and projects and to learn the engineering and business disciplines that are used throughout the world from the company that invented many of them.,ConsIt's a big company in an industry that is really struggling. Opportunities for advancement| travel and perks are few and far between. Morale has fallen and staff reductions are happening every year| if not twice a year. Starting a new job at Ford at this time would be risky regardless of your talent| just because of the lack of seniority you would have.,0,,
23/2/2009,He drove us to deliver our best product.,5,Current Employee - Zone Manager,ProsThe people and the products. Great team| especially in the field officies that pulls together and motivates our dealer body to drive customers into our great new products. Finally we are building all the products for North America that have excelled in the rest of the world| Euro Focus| Fiesta| etc.,ConsThe historically low sales volume and the tough economy is making it tougher to implement our turn around plan.

4/3/2009,No Direction - Time to cut at the top!,2,Current Employee - NVH Engineer,ProsThe Money was great| the benifits were top notch too. Work life balance was always a priority. The people at your level are very helpful and great to work with. You should get all the training you can while there since they'll pay for everything.,ConsManagment couldn't care less about your development. Getting forced ranked within your pay grade and being new in that grade is very unfair. They have some of the worst people in high levels and the best people are stuck under the leadership levels. Your supervisior has a huge impact on you in that if you leave him alone and no one is complaining about you| you're fine but you're not really developing as a professional either.,-2,,
19/2/2009,Ford was a great place to work| and maybe again if they can turn it around.,4,Former Employee - Engineering Manager,ProsChallenging work| especially with new vehicle programs. The opportunity to engineer something that is seem by everyday people is very rewarding. Everytime that I get in a car and drive I see the product of my professional efforts. Occasionally you here of stories of where you made a difference. There was a U tube video of a horific accident somewhere out west. The vehicle was one I worked on and I could see that the parts I designed held up| and possibly saved lives.,ConsThe company has been shrinking for years| demotions are more common than promotions and the jobs are very vulernable especially if you have low seniority and have moved up quickly.,0,,

The problems to be solved are complex and compelling.,ConsManagement at all levels is only interested in their own interests - not the interests of the Company| it's customers| and certainly not it's employees. Micro-management is rampant as is lack of direction| lack of decision making| lack of innovation| lack of honesty| and just a plain lack of caring. Caring about anything except their own skin.,-10,,

If you are self motivated and willing to be creative to meet your sales targets then you should find this a great company to work for.

12/2/2009,Strong leader keeps Ford #1 domestic in profits| despite strong headwinds.,4,Current Employee - Marketing Manager,ProsBeing part of a domestic manufacturing company. Marketing organization leads the strategy of the company.,ConsCorporate red tape. Unsure job prospects going forward. Unclear path to promotion They have yet to ask for federal aid due to a jumbo loan it took out in late 2006| and may soon have to because of danger of running out of cash before auto sales recover. But the chances of that recovery seem to dim by the day as layoffs jolt the economy| further eroding consumer confidence. The concern now is that domestic automakers may not be able to shrink enough to survive an even more severe downturn. The federal stimulus package of more than $800 billion expected to become law this month includes provisions to allow consumers to deduct some loan interest and sales taxes on vehicle purchases.,0,,

There is an opportunity is some areas| not all| to achieve Work Life balance| by telecommuting or working an alternative work schedule. Christmas holiday is about 10 days and allows one to recharge at year end.,ConsThe current economic conditions make Ford Motor a tenuous place to work. There have been 3 steady years of downsizing and restructuring| which make it difficult and stressful. There are many cliques| and in many instances it is not what you know but who you know.,-2,,

31/1/2009,Ford Motor Company Finance Information.,3,Current Employee - Finance Supervisor,ProsGreat to work on exciting products at the Company. Within Product Development specifically you have the opportunity to work on next generation vehicle programs that are in the corporate pipeline. Product Development at a car company is much more interesting than most as you're developing highly visible products that truly add value to people's lives on a daily basis as opposed to a component supplier| or consumer products company where you're making slight changes to existing products. You have a great chance to truly drive organizational change and an incredible opportunity to work with not only cross functional groups (Marketing| Planning| Engineering| Purchasing| etc) but also other organizations such as Corporate and the Customer Service Division.,ConsSome of the downsides include the lack of respect for one's personal time from operating management. While the overall time spent at work varies drastically from Finance job to Finance job within Ford| PD Programs and Engineering management are very demanding and often times call meetings early in the morning (7 AM) and late in the evening (6 PM or later). Also| the amount of meetings in a day is simply incomprehensible. Often times one can spend 7 hours a day in meetings in PD Finance. Once again this will vary and likely be less in other Organizations within Ford.,0,,

18/1/2009,Ford Motor is better all the time| great place to work compared to a few years ago.,3,Former Employee - Assembler,ProsWhen you work at Ford you have a chance to do your best and make a fair wage. Ford tries to make the plant safe and clean. Some other companies' plants are dark and not the cleanest place in the world. I don't like to have to wear hearing protection all through an eight hour work day week after month and Ford sure has tried to make the plant quieter and certianly cleaner than a few years| used to be dark and smelly to say the least.,ConsEveryone would like to have a raise now and again| maybe next year.,0,,

Opportunities to work around the country and to have hands on experience. I felt empowered to do as I felt neccessary and complete tasks on time.

13/1/2009,It Ain't What It Use To Be,2,Former Employee - Project Manager,ProsCollect a paycheck. Plenty of holidays! Not much micromanaging going on (at least the areas I have been exposed to). The benefits are okay| but they are gradually diminishing. Depending upon the department| you could really get some good training in.,"ConsVery unfair ..... Ford wrote the book on politics. Performance reviews and promotions are based upon who you know| not actual work performance. Very unstable. You never know which day will be your last. No room for advancement and opportunities are extremely limited. Lately| there have been several years of ""no raises"" for employees. Very limited list of projects to work on.",-1,,

Benefits are pretty good and with the global reach of the company you can work almost anywhere...again with the right skill set. Most managers are very professional and offer reasonable developmental opportunities. Salaries are targeted to be mid-point within the industry.,"ConsOver the past 5 years there has been continous downsizing. You never know if you have seen the last ""adjustment"" so very few people feel secure. The company tends to ""reorganize"" on an annual basis which again causes instability. Politics are rampant among managers.",-1,,
27/1/2009,Avoid Ford.,1,Former Employee - IT Manager,Pros- The pay is good compared to similar jobs in the Detroit area.- The company has global reach| so you will be able to interact with a large number of people from other countries and cultures. Since it's a global company| you also have the opportunity of finding jobs out side the United States.- You have the opportunity to work in a wide variety of jobs within your field.,Cons- Poor job security - layoffs are happening every six months lately.- Automotive is a Really Bad Industry right now| and for the next several years.- The company is in really bad shape| financially.,-6,,
7/1/2009,Difficult times at Ford now| but the products are spectacular.,2,Current Employee - Supervisor,ProsPeople here are never bored| there is plenty of work for those who want to work| the employees are fairly compensated but slowly over time this is being cut at every opportunity. It is fairly close to home for me and the commute is good| especially when compared to LA| New York| Boston or other large cities.,ConsThere is absolutely no job security now as there seem to be 10% to 15% headcount cuts every six months. The health| insurance and other benefits being cut every year. There are no raises or bonuses for the workers| but the upper lever management bonuses are absurd - often multiple times their salary when the salaried workforce might get 5% and we're told that we should be greatful!,-1,,
8/1/2009,A troubled company for some time to come.,2,Former Employee - Product Creation Applications Engineer,ProsNever-ending challenges| high technology| good pay and benefits. Opportunities for professional growth are good to excellent if one takes advantages of existing resources and opportunities. For an IT professional like myself| unless you are a project manager or analyst| you will have a more stable career path rather than as a coder or deep technical specialist.,ConsBloated management structure| few opportunities for promotion| confrontation averse. Current work atmosphere is one of doom and gloom| and adds to the pressure of meeting deliverables with additional staff being fired on a regular basis. There is a huge cultural inertia that prevents new ideas or process changes from taking place due to embedded policies| organizational silos| and personal fiefdoms. Until Mulally can focus on changing the culture to position it for future growth rather than firefighting to save the ship| it is probably best to watch safely from afar.,0,,
6/1/2009,Student Picker,3,Former Employee - Shipping/Receiving of Parts and Materials,ProsI worked as a summer student at the PDC in Bramalea. The job paid my tuition. For the amount of work most students actually had to do| the money was unbeatable. It was nice to work with other students who had similar aspirations and experiences with Ford because one or more relative worked for the company.,ConsIt was sweaty| frustrating work. As students we had to pay union dues but were not at all protected by the union. The system for deciding who made mistakes was majorly flawed and the supervisors did not understand how the centre ran so they were ill-equipped to understand most of the issues that we faced on a daily basis.,0,,

High pressure| long hours| especially for above average performersIt is very easy to become ""just a cog in a wheel"". Your career opportunities depends on you and support form lower and middle engineering management| which can be arbitrary. Doing a ""good job"" is not sufficient. Persons who are willing to work long hours are promoted even if they are not the best candidate.The current shuffling of lower and middle level engineering management means many of them are under qualified| or at least under experienced| for their current job. These people revert to telling the bosses what they think they wants to hear instead of what they need to hear.",-1,,
25/12/2008,Its a good ride but you have to know when to get off.,2,Current Employee - Maintenance Supervisor,ProsFord Motor Company can be a very good place to work. They pay very well and have a very good benefit package for their salaried positions. As a supervisor of hourly employees you get paid overtime. In a manufacturing plant a person with as little as an associates degree can come in and start as a floor supervisor. There is always the remote possibility of promotion in whatever position you are in while working on the floor. There is allot of experience to be had working for Ford Motor Company. Working as a maintenance supervisor in a Ford Motor Company manufacturing plant is a great launching point for future jobs.,ConsFord Motor Company's manufacturing plants have a tendency to be black holes for a career. When a person begins their career at Ford Motor Company as a floor maintenance or production supervisor there is an extremely high probability that they will end it there. The management hierarchy is bloated and highly protective of their positions. The morale is extremely low for most of the floor supervisors. Raises and bonuses are few and very far between. Its hard to get anything more then a handshake for Christmas. Job security is a bit scary| when ford cuts jobs they slice the bottom first.,0,,

Most of this comes from the way the organization once was rather the way it is now.,"ConsVery hierarchical organization. Management still recalls the ""good ole days"" and are very resistent to change. The organization is full of ineffeciencies. Many people have worked there for 10 to 30+ years and have not adapted to the new reality of Ford and it's place in the world. Many of the middle level managers are there simply to wordsmith documents| even internal memos.",-1,

I also have a very strong work ethic which keeps me going. I get a lot done and it makes me feel great about myself. This is a good reason for working for any company including Ford.,"ConsVery political. It's not your results| it's who you impress. I am sick and tired of working hard while watching less qualified people get promoted. The reality is that if you are not part of the ""club"" or not one of the protected groups like black| female or hispanic| you can deliver the world but there will always be an excuse why you cannot be promoted.

Second| Ford maintains world-class vehicle test and measurement facilities. As an engineer| you can form a hypothesis and then get to testing it| right away. Third| engineering automobiles is challenging and rewarding...never a dull moment at Ford.The vast majority of employees are hard working and consciensous.

There are great leaders in the right positions at Ford but far too many mediocre managers clogging its main arteries. And guess what...there's not a damn thing you can do about it.

3/12/2008,Ford Motor Company is a fantastic place to work if management manages and engineers engineer.,3,Current Employee - Senior Engineer/6-Sigma Master Black Belt,ProsThe automobile industry is a very dynamic environment to work in and has continuous challenges. The design and development of automobiles is one of the most complicated engineering tasks in the world. There are more than 20|000 parts that have to come together to build a vehicle. The level of coordination needed to do this successfully is incredible. Outsiders take it for granted how complex and reliable the vehicles are that are manufactured today. All car companies have increased vehicle quality and reliability to levels that were unheard of just 10 years ago. Because of these challenges Ford is a great place to work if you want to constantly be challenged to perform at a high level under very tight schedules. Never let it be said that the car industry is boring because if you get involved you will constantly be working to engineer the next great product.,ConsThe biggest downside is the lack of vision towards the future. Working in the engineering community| I spend most my time just trying to keep up with the new product cycles and launch schedules. I have very little input/time to think of the future and how I can improve Ford. The engineering decisions are made at higher levels than me and I have very little say as to the direction taken.Another downside is the lack of respect given to the engineering community from the management at Ford. It is often forgotten how tough this type of work can be and the sacrifices we make to get products delivered on time and within budget. An engineer is no longer just an engineer| we are cost analysts| sales| testing and engineering rolled up into one.,-1,,

It's a great brand that everyone cares about and has an opinion about their products. They have a great legacy and are a company that is woven within the very fabric of American history. They're owned by the Ford family and are less likely to be carved up like GM or Chrysler. The F-150 is an amazing piece of machinery and so is the Mustang. You get to work from home quite a bit (at least in the Sales and Marketing organization). The Dealer Model Introductory shows and the auto shows are pretty fun to attend| too. They sponsor ski resorts| too. So free ski tickets. airline miles and hotel points accumulate rapidly.,"ConsWell| unless you've been living under a rock| the biggest downside has been the hemorrhaging of cash. The dealer network is too saturated. There is a bad quality perception (unnecessary these days). The company is very hierarchal. The management pyramid is very steep and with all of the layoffs| movement isn't going to happen much in the near term. They're looking where to scrimp. They've been hammering at individual and family deductibles and premiums| obligating the employee to shoulder more of the cost. They don't pay very well. They have an old mentality of ""If we build it| the dealers have to take it.""

Direct supervisors are universally competent with the automobile. It is very easy to succeed in your job at Ford. You are made to feel important 100% of the time.,ConsWayne co. Michigan is depressing. Ford is an outstanding place to work| but SE Michigan is frightful for many reasons.

13/10/2008,Good stepping stone for knowledge,4,Current Employee - Testing Engineer,ProsHybrid technologies are increasing and they have some great research divisions. The hybrids may not be getting the attention that they deserve but the quality and technology of the products on the market give them best buys from reviews. Customer satisfaction and converts from other auto makers are extremely high for them and with the products they have discussed seems like the area to be in. The work life balance seems to be getter better as compensation time has helped recently instead of just giving as free overtime. If you want to travel| there are positions available to see the world with.,ConsMoral is in the bucket| stock prices are historic lows| our marketing teams don't seem to get it as they're out of touch with reality.

15/10/2008,Ford is a good place to work if you are ready to take charge of your career yourself.,4,Former Employee - Product Design Engineer,ProsProduct Design Engineers have the freedom to dictate the direction his/her parts take in the development process. As long as you make sound engineering judgements| preferably with data to back up your reasoning| your management will support you. Also| you get a breath of experience as a Ford PD Engr such as managing suppliers on the technical aspects of the job (designing| prototyping| testing| etc)| interacting with program management and purchasing about cost and timing| and dealing with plants to resolve assembly issues. Whether you decide to stay at Ford long-term or not| a PD experience at Ford will definitely help you develop engineering skills that will transfer well to other technical industries.,ConsYou are responsible for your own recognition and career development. Upper management will not notice you unless you make yourself seen and heard. Those who resolve a crisis quickly with flying colors (although they may have caused the problem in the first place) tend to be noticed more than those who do their job the right way the first time and fly under the radar. You definitely need to constantly update your superiors on what successes you have been achieving every couple of weeks so they don't forget you during PR and promotion time. Also| if you want to rotate to a different team| you will need to pursue it yourself as your superiors will not plan your career for you.,0,,
27/10/2008,Just my thoughts,3,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsFord Motor used to be a great company to work for. Entering as a college graduate| I had the possibility to move across multiple organizations within Ford (product development| marketing & sales| manufacturing and finance). This may still be an option| but seems very limited as employees are worried to 'start new' in a different organization when further layoffs are looming. At this point| I believe Ford still offers a very good benefits package.,ConsThe company is too large and stuck in a bureaucratic process that slows down project turn-around time. Also| outsourcing many of its IT components has a negative impact on company morale. Why should employees believe in their company when their jobs are going overseas? And even more importantly| who will buy 'American' and Ford products when all the work is done in India and Asia?,-1,,

It is considered ok to work from home or occasionally go home early as long as the work gets done. There is also an ability to work different schedules depending on your child care arrangements and other outside committments such as caring for a sick family member or just wanting to save money on gas. Telecommuting is allowed. Part time long term employment with partial benefits is also ok. The management lease program is great. Managers get to lease a new car with insurance included every year.,ConsThe current economy and downsizing has increased workload and stress. Benefit costs have increased over the years.

You never have to explain to someone what your Company does or makes. Also| the Ford Motor Company product| contrary to perception| is equal in quality to Best in Class Toyota. New products coming in 2010 from Europe will assist in the recovery of Ford quite handsomely. Very talented workforce.,ConsPoor overall performance of the company has trickle down effect on professional development and career advancement. Company is going through fourth consecutive year of downsizing| which has resulted in a workforce that is scared| uncertain of their personal future| and tired of the subjective assessment of their performance (linked into deciding who gets the axe),-1,,
20/8/2008,Be a part of the solution| not the problem.,3,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsIf you enjoy automobiles| working for an automotive company is satisfying.,ConsThis is a very difficult time to be an automotive company.,0,,
1/8/2008,Ford a great place to work if you can keep your job.,4,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsExcellent salary structure - good benefits.There is opportunitiy for advancement if you are willing to go the extra mile and put in the time. Great core group of people who care about running the business correctly.Safety is a real concern and taken very seriously.,ConsInstability of job market. Current job market is very limited| much of advancement opportunity has been extremely limited in the last few years due to reduction in plants / volumes. Work environment can be a bit harsh if you are in the factory.As with many very large companies things do not move quickly on due to the layers of management approval and paperwork required.,0,,

13/8/2008,We never knew how good the good old days were.,2,Former Employee - Strategy Manager,ProsThe salary and benefits were very very good| unfortunatly many people were grossly over compensated. When the domestic auto industry was solid it was a great place to work.,"ConsIt's so big and clumsy there is a tremendous inertia to change. The last 3 years most everyone was afraid of losing their jobs they either did nothing or tried to stand out and get noticed it created what I call ""bad behavior"" and drove wasteful ideas and programs out of despiration.",-1,,
31/7/2008,Work here for Benefits| Comp| but beware of Upside Potential and Firm's long term outlook,3,Former Employee - Senior Securitization Analyst,ProsGood compensation| good benefits| potential for long term stability if present issues are solved.,ConsSignificant business challenges lie ahead| making the overall prognosis for success unclear. Very difficult to get promoted unless you are deemed a star. Limited opportunities until the business climate improves. Poor feedback on performance and very little opportunity for recognition for success.,0,,
14/7/2008,Ford An American Legacy Lost,4,Current Employee - Systems Consultant,ProsBenefits| work life balance.. The company has a very respectable benefits and work flexibility policy,ConsThe old-boy network nothing gets done because everyone is afraid to upset their superior with a better idea,-1,,
14/7/2008,Family owned| tries hard| but still has a long way to go,4,Former Employee - Product Engineer,"ProsOverall| Ford still believes in it's people and to a certain extent| the extended ford ""family"". It tries it's best to put people's work first| offering good benefits| some tuition assistance programs| flexible schedules/work days (4 day/10 hour) despite economic hardship in the industry. Some of these programs have probably been axed due to budget cuts| but even despite it's size| the management is still family operated.",ConsUnfortunately| the industry is just not a growing sector. The American automotive sector is on the decline| of which there are many reasons. The large bureaucracy/organizational structures created in the 50's stifles risk taking| creativity| and innovation. Also| the outdated concept of the UAW (Note: research non-unionized plants in the US owned by foreign competitors| BMW/Toyota| and how much more nimble they are to adapt| esp. to flexible manufacturing).,0,,
12/7/2008,The future is looking quite good.,4,Current Employee - Intern,ProsFord Motor Company is one of the largest manufacturing firms in the world and is #7 on the FORTUNE 500 list for 2008. Just a few years ago| it was madly profitable and the owner of such renowned brands as Aston Martin| Jaguar| Land Rover| and Hertz. Sadly| those days are over| the stock price has plummeted from its peak| and thousands of white and blue collar workers have been laid off.However| while the North American segment has suffered| Ford is experiencing tremendous success in South America| Europe| Russia| and Asia and the mass exodus of management talent appears to have stopped since Alan Mullaly came over from Boeing. Although the company appears to be in terrible shape at the moment| there is great promise ahead. With the transition to global vehicle platforms in the near future| new vehicles will look and feel the same across all continents eliminating the constant yearning in the US for the European variants of the Fiesta| Focus| and Mondeo cars.In addition to their Escape and Mariner hybrid SUVs| Ford is bringing to market new Fusion and Milan hybrid sedans in 2009 and will start selling brand new Fiesta and Focus small cars (on the global platform) in 2010. With the new Flex| MKT| F-150| F-100| Mustang| and Taurus appearing soon| the product mix will certainly become more diversified and much more competitive.Fuel prices are killing the auto industry at this time| but Ford has chosen to invest in proven technologies like 6-speed automatic transmissions| electric power steering| better aerodynamics| lighter materials| etc. that not only improve fuel economy| but keep the cost of the vehicle reasonable.Mulally has made some difficult decisions| but if Ford can weather the storm these next few years| they will come out stronger| leaner| and better than ever. So although the current climate may be glum| they are poised for sure success in the next decade.,ConsWith very little capital sitting around to spend on refurbishing office spaces| buying new printers and more powerful computers| providing office phones and cell phones to the workers| and other such niceties most employees expect to enjoy| the office environment| at least where I work| is nothing special and actually quite outdated.There is very little budgeted for travel expenses| so in times past| when engineers needed to head to another factory for a couple of days| they are now confined to Southeast Michigan and teleconferencing. The money is also especially tight when it comes to computer upgrades| getting office phones installed| or getting a work cell phone. For new workers| it's basically impossible.In the past two years| more than 30% of the white collar work force has been cut| so this naturally leads to diminishing morale and more work for the lucky ones who are left. As well| the parking lots and office areas are a bit more empty| too.For those predisposed to dislike hierarchical management structures| staying away from Ford would be a must. There are layers upon layers of supervisors and managers stuffed between Mulally at the top and the entry-level engineer at the bottom. Starting from my position on the bottom rung| there is a section supervisor| an area supervisor| the executive engineer for Automatic Transmission Operations| the North American Director of Powertrain Operations| the Group Vice President of Manufacturing| and then the big cheese| CEO Alan Mulally who technically reports to Executive Chairman Bill Ford| Jr.,0,,
16/7/2008,Exciting place to work if you know how to work hard and handle the stress.,3,Current Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsExciting field and ever changing. Each day there is always something different going on.,ConsCan be long hours. Definitely stressful during an economic downturn such as the one we are currently facing.,0,,
11/7/2008,Ford: engineering is your business not an expence,3,Former Employee - Applications Engineer,ProsCars are facinating complex devices and this complexity means that there is always something new and different to keep you going. Currently there is a lot of work to do so the up side potential is very large.,ConsManagements facination with business models and the seeming lack of understanding on their part that they aren't playing a game in business school. They are hurting people and the economy with their incompetance.,-1,,
30/7/2008,Ford is dying,1,Current Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsIt is a family-oriented company| meaning that it values work-life balance and allows you to spend plenty of time with your family. Other than that| I do not believe there are any good reasons to work at Ford.,"ConsFord is a dying company. It has been downsizing since 2001. It is looking to cut costs everywhere| which means it hasn't given a pay raise to anyone in over 2.5 years and it has slashed benefits. When I joined the company out of college| they recruited me on the following platform: ""Come work for Ford and we'll pay for your MBA at an evening program in the area| such as U of M."" Well| I started the program earlier this year| and Ford suddenly discontinued their tuition assistance program| telling us we could just drop out of school if we couldn't afford to keep going. I was promised a promotion back in April| and then it got delayed until July| and then until this upcoming October| but now it might simply be canceled altogether.Ford used to be a great company. Unfortunately| it is a very unprofitable| poorly managed company that will betray its employees in order to save a buck.",-5,,
28/7/2008,When will things improve?,1,Current Employee - Engineer,ProsCar discount| buyouts offered| ability to hide from work (although not easy anymore)| advanced degree tuition support| over 5 healthcare program choices,ConsContinuous shrinking| lack of foresight of global energy needs,-1,,
23/6/2008,From inside a company going through hard times,4,Current Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsIt is a company with a big history. Everybody knows and talks about Ford Motor Company and its performance. It is interesting to have an inside point of view and specially to work with the company in its efforts to become profitable once again,ConsSometimes people is not very optimistic about the company perfomance and that can be frustrating,0,,
30/6/2008,There is still a chance for Ford to turn the corner.,3,Current Employee - Technical Expert,ProsThe people make it a great place to work.,"Cons(1) There are too many ""yes-men""| (2) there is still a mindset for ""empire building"" among upper management| (3) individual performance is still valued more than team performance (e.g. the key performance of a ""role"" player)| (4) the mindset of ""what can I do"" to make my co-worker succeed is absent",0,,
13/6/2008,good review,4,Current Employee - Network Engineer,ProsI like the working atmosphere here at Ford Motor Co including telecomutting| paid vacations| etc. I could have possibly well balance my life between my family and my career.,ConsFord Motor Co's business is not diversified and therefore it's going through tough time aligning it's business which is only in auto manufacturing. I feel if it had had well diversified it's business like GE| it wouldn't had to face this time lime especially during this economic down turn.,0,,

12/6/2008,An executive with high integrity who is perceived as being honest in communications,4,Current Employee - Human Resources Manager,ProsEmployees passionate for the auto business. There is a new focus on accountability in the Company with and honest recognition that the old ways of doing business will not win the war. The Company appears to be less wed to the historical Ford legacy which is slower to evolve and address the changing industry. Over time| Ford will become less of a family legacy business| to a results driven business that doesn't mute strong leadership and drives differentiation from the competitors. Product design is starting to take a stronger role in the Company| but still a long way from being an industry leader.,"ConsToo much ""Detroit think"". Difficult to attract up and coming mid level talent during a time when the industry is in such turmoil.",0,,
12/6/2008,Good company to work for when the auto industry is doing well,4,Former Employee - IT Engineer,ProsThere are a lot of opportunities to expand you knowledge to different areas of the business. Work/life balance is the best of any company I have worked for. The benefits used to be top notch| but have been reduced in recent years. Still better than most other companies.,ConsPoor senior management communication. Ford needs to change with the times and it is business as usual from decades past. The constant turmoil of the automotive industry puts a lot of strain on the employees.,0,,
12/6/2008,How an hourly Ford worker see the company,4,Current Employee - Assembler,ProsThe pay and benefits| even though they are shinking| are still the best around. Ford also provides a great opportunity to work in a diverse work environment. The concept of working as a team is also stressed to the the continuous build process. If the first person does the job wrong| the next will have problems.,ConsSome of the downsides are that performance has little effect on the way you are viewed and advanced. Senority is key. The work on the body is strenuous and wears it down. Employees are also given too many opportunities to keep their jobs. The company and union need to work together to keep the strongest work force| not just a high number of employees.,0,,
12/6/2008,Ford needs to act like a smaller company| not just be one.,4,Current Employee - IT PTG,ProsFord is a great place to work for good work-life balance. There is also a high level of diversity amongst employees| and people from all different cultures work here. Most people are friendly and welcoming. Everyone makes you feel like you're welcome and wanted| even if its fake at times.,"ConsThere's way too much red tape in the process. The company is full of bureaucracy. The worst problem is that higher management does not know what it is doing. Every 1-2 years| there tends to be a new mantra for higher management. Everyone moves in that direction| then two years later| its gone - discarded - kaput! Then| a new manager comes in; with a new mantra. There's a lot of ""waste"" (i.e. TPS muda) in every process.",0,,
16/6/2008,Live the future today.,5,Former Employee - Human Resources,ProsBest place to learn how big companies are changing to survive the challenges of globalization. Good people who are tough| supportive and eager to see their company survive the global auto wars| on top.,ConsCulture is a complex mix of fear| pride and insider dealings. Attempts to build trust are just that| the old axiom of actions speak louder than words would apply.,0,,
15/6/2008,No surprises at Ford... a big company trying to do well.,3,Current Employee - Financial Analyst,ProsHas a great reputation within the finance realm. Most employees generally try to do the right thing and want the company to do well ... very supportive of coworkers and willing to help/offer ideas. Definitely not a cut-throat environment.,ConsVery little control over where you work and what you are doing. Opportunities for advancement occur behind closed doors without open communication. Inefficient systems and processes balloon in size while number of employees and staffed functions dwindle. Typical older| larger company issues ... lots of history (has always been done this way) with marked differences in perspective. Company does not value any work experience gained outside of Ford (i.e.: 10+ years external experience with MBA on same level as entry level BBA with no work experience since same time at Ford is put in). Too much manual| mind-numbing work and reliance on Excel.,-1,,
13/6/2008,Things will get better but need to wait another 2-3 years...if you can....,2,Current Employee - Buyer,ProsMgmt want to help salaried work force have a good work-life balance. Optomistic about the future but things are very dififcult now. Promotions are very difficlut to come by. Overall good comapny that will make it through this difficutt period| just need to wait it out if you can.,ConsPay and benefits are being reduced| unfair business environment relative to competition due to regulatory issues. Need government support as other companies have to get competitive advantage back. More work with less people.,-2,,

12/6/2008,The jury is still out,3,Current Employee - Manager,ProsGreat products and very good people to work with. Ford hires strong people| who have a passion for the automotive industry.,ConsFord needs to get out of the continuous downsize mode. The product plan has been tilted toward trucks and SUV's| and there has been a market shift toward cars. Also| Ford needs to act as a more global company| and take advantage of great products that we make around the world.,0,,

Health care slowly being taken away. retirement may not be pssable in just a few years. Management has begun taking out there anger on the hourly work force. Talking between the hourly work force and mangement has stopped. Ideas that might save money or the company are not taken to the upper management or are changed to make them seem like bad ideas. Cost cutting programs are started even when it costs more money then the old way. Safty at some buildings for hour work force has been ignored. Some managements ideas on safty are simple as this statement ""We might if the problem if some one get hurt.""",0,,
25/6/2008,Ford| not a bad place to start,1,Current Employee - Zone Manager,ProsThere is a reasonably high level of job security| and if you desire to live in Detroit then it's the best place to be. Internal information systems are good for performing your actual job. It's not a bad place to start a career.,"ConsCurrent state of the economy and of US Automotive in general ensures that there will forever be ""head count"" reductions and cost reductions...translation small bonuses and an ever decreasing pool of management positions. There is still a very strong ""old boys"" club which makes it difficult to advance.",-1,,
