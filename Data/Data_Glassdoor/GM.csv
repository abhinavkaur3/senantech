30/6/2017,Race to the Bottom/Manufacturing,2,Current Employee - Senior Engineer,ProsCo-workers are great; Amazing amount of potential. With actual long-term goals in place| would be an amazing place to work for. Products themselves can be hit-or-miss| but are usually interesting.,ConsAt least in the manufacturing realm| the #1 motivator is fear. Anyone that can't be intimidated is eventually squeezed out to make for a compliant salaried workforce. Primary measurement in effect is Cost-per-unit: which is silly when you consider that the only lever that can be pulled at a plant level to adjust this is labor (hint: Understaff on purpose and enforce 'casual' overtime). I've worked or Co-op'ed in several GM manufacturing plants| and this is the case in pretty much every one.Rumor was| my current facility was dead-last of all manufacturing facilities in the Workplace-of-Choice survey in 2015. What floored me was that the 'interview' portion (which used an outside firm to gather anonymous feedback) was scheduled during a week where the plant was in shutdown: meaning that there weren't any employees around other than the select few that 'just so happened' to be in working overtime projects. To my knowledge| we have not been given the opportunity to do another plant-specific survey since.Arbitrary measurements: goal plans and glide-paths generally don't reflect real business conditions. Most of the Level 1/2/3 production measurements are set up on a weekly/monthly cycle which greatly rewards short-term decision making. This is especially frustrating for a maintenance expenditure: there's absolutely no way to amortize a large maintenance cost (i.e.| a $30|000 motor) on a monthly budget. [Case in point: A machine was failing| replacement part cost was $15|000| but because the plant would have been 'red' for the monthly maintenance budget| instead of planning the replacement and purchasing the components| it was band-aided and continued to run. When it eventually failed the next month| the damage caused an additional $20|000 of collateral damage| and incurred several shifts of downtime until it could be repaired. There was no effort to acknowledge that the additional cost was due to a failure to act| because by the measurements it was a better outcome]Systems that are put in place for standardization never seem to be evaluated for efficacy in a closed-loop manner: the end result is a lot of motion that creates the illusion of work. Sad part is| every time there's a 'critical failure' we manage to add yet another required system on top of the 8 that were already there. Why this appears to work: the fear of having to go through another GMS/5-Why/Fishbone/RedX/Root Cause Analysis/Problem Solving Tool/Diagonal Slice/TPM/Six-Sigma/OpEX exercise causes employees to either avoid doing *anything* involving risk| or to hide the mistake and hope no-one finds out (I must point out that Bob Lutz acknowledges and nails this fact very| very hard in one of his recent books).,-1,,

Seems like no one stays in one place for more than 5 years| and often less.,ConsCorporate sluggishness -I'd imagine this comes with most companies the size of GM| but it's frustrating how much documentation and review is required for even small software changes. This definitely puts us at a disadvantage when trying to remain on the cutting edge of innovation.Upper management feels distant - Again| it's a huge company| but I've never even seen any of the upper execs.

It is your right to do whatever you wanted to with these funds because it is YOUR money. They always told me that I was coming back and that they would find placement for me. This never materialised like all their promises. I find this extremely unethical and a breach of your basic human rights.

I've heard from managers here that it is the ""best place to work in GM""| and that it is ""GM's elite organization"". I'm sorry| but Treasury is a risk mitigating department| and its purpose is to protect the company from financial turmoil by managing cash flow. The ultimate failure of a treasury department is bankruptcy. The organization does nothing innovative and really does not contribute to the bottom line| but the impression I've gotten is that this organization thinks it is the brains of the company| and that the company would fail without its expertise. Some of the work might sound interesting at a high level| but in actuality boils down to 1. following the rules and 2. managing bureaucracy.",0,,

26/2/2017,No Brainer For College Hire To Work Here... DO IT!,5,Current Employee - Software Developer,"ProsHonestly| I don't think you can get much better as a college hire to work here from what I have seen so far. I was hired out of college and have been here a year and a half so far and I don't have anything to complain about it at all. Compared to my fellow students who worked at consulting firms mostly| it really seems like GM cares way more about people and has more perks.I work in software dev| but it has been great| some of the perks:- Raise every 6 months for first 3 years as a new college hire. (this is huge| no one else gets raises like this and they have competitive starting rates as other companies for sure)- very good health insurance| it's $30 a month| but it's the kind where you don't need a referral to see a specialist. there's a $1500 deductible| but the company gives you a $1500 health savings account every year to use towards it when you do a physical| so basically no deductible| not sure how it would be for families though- everyone on earth knows GM| huge resume booster. when you tell people you work here| you always hear ""ooohhh| cool"" and stuff like that. it's a really respectable thing to say you work here.- 401k matching| up to 8%. they give you 4% right off the bat of your salary every month| then they match up to 4% on top of that. so if i put in 10% into 401k| and they put in 8%| it would be as if i'm saving 18% of salary each month. the 401k vests in 3 years| so you need to stay for 3 years in order for the money to become officially yours once you work there.- able to rotate| you can rotate jobs every 1 year if you want as a college hire| in a company this big| you can pretty much do any job you want once you are in. i know they are big on training people so i think you can go into any other vertical too if they need people.- very willing to teach and help you learn more| like sending you to training events and the likes- bonus every year based on company performance. the bonuses are pretty decent| as a college hire| then they will put money on top of that if company performance is good. it really depends on company performance though| but so far this year has been a record breaking year so we did pretty good on bonuses.- multiple innovation centers to work at. they have people in austin| tx| chandler| az| warren| mi| detroit| mi and atlanta| ga- if you have a masters degree... DO IT. you get a higher starting salary then other college hires| and you are locked into the raises every 6 months. once you stay at the company for 3 years| you get promoted into the next level| and that also comes with it's own raise. also| make sure to do an internship or have some kind of experience related to your job before starting| they will start you at a higher salary as well for experience that you've had. my starting salary matched my friends who i went to school with| but they didn't have raises like this.- if you have a bachelors| you can start working towards your masters degree and they will pay for it right when you start. they give you enough to cover 1 or 2 classes per semester| which is honestly enough because working full time and doing the degree can be really intense| especially in a graduate degree.- if you move from another state| they will give you money to relocate| which is honestly way more then you need as a single person- of course| really good experience and really building a strong skillset. i would probably consider working here for a very long time. many people i work with have been working with the company for 10+ years which shows how good it is.- this is one i didnt think about| but free parking. it seems like many of my friends who don't work here actually have to pay to park to work at their companies. GM has garages that they cover you on which is nice.- the whole company in general is really big on helping it's people. many automotive folks have worked here for years and years and retire here| so I think the old union focus is still here. as opposed to trying to trim down the bottom line for everyone and only care about boosting profits| i really feel like they try to help people out with their benefits compared to other companies i've been to.",Cons- honestly| i've had no cons from my experience. i think it really would depend on what team you are on. the management and where you sit make your experience. i've only heard good things from other co workers. but if you don't like your team| you do have the option of moving around as i said before.,-4,,

Don't forget that GM employee discount on cars.,"ConsStill remnants of the ""good old days"". Senior employees that show up very early to avoid work and leave early.

In most IT groups| you can't be promoted unless you dedicate every waking moment of your life to your job - instead you have to leave the group to get the promotion you need or have someone leave. They let really knowledgeable workers walk out the door. The infrastructure is a mess. They go with whatever brand/products are the cheapest. They are trying to hire a bunch of new college hire developers to develop 80% apps in house and throw them into a group| train them and have them do repetitive tasks over and over again. It's very common to walk around and see people hanging out on Facebook or playing games. There are a massive amount of people that are not technical at all and I have no idea how they got the job.

You would think that a company that is trying to get into the Automated Car business would be cutting a top notch technical environment. You would be mistaken. The technology they are using was outdated before I began my career. For instance a java project I worked on wasn't using a dependency management system| it literally had dependent jar files checked into SVN.Another project I worked on kept falling over because it was trying to remove records from a database via JDBC... it was actually going through all the records| reading them into memory| and then going through them one by one to issue a delete... millions of rows... I watched a very senior level employee spending hour upon hour trying to trouble shoot this thing. How would you solve this? Well you'd just double the CPU and memory of course (True story)The consensus amongst employee's is ""it pays very good""| now picture yourself with a bunch of coworkers all with this same mindset. If that's that seems like a compromise you are willing to take then go for it| you will get paid very good!Note for new college grads (I was not one| but feel I need to put out a PSA) If you are told you will be doing software development... you won't... You'll be writing test scripts... all day every day... and not using some cool scripting language... think 3rd party gui tools like SOAP UI.",-2,,

Also I did not like recently finding out that come March all of us on second shift would be eliminated. We were told that webworms be hired in after 90 days| that came and went and it did not happen| then another 90 days came and went and still no hire in and no explanation other than ""we'll get to you"" which does not sit well with me.

13/11/2016,Persons with mental disabilities beware.,2,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,"ProsThe ""Golden Handcuffs"" or benefits if you will| are bar none| the best of any employer out there. 4% donation to your 401K just for showing up every day| plus a 1:1 match up to another 4%| plus BCBS as low as $280 a month with a 3K responsibility until 10% copay to 5K out of pocket maximum is absolutely fantastic. higher level of coverage puts your out of pocket maximum at around 3K but costs more in the end| and is better to go with lower coverage level and put the difference into the HSA in case you don't spend it all. Provides the ability to carry over that money to next year. Also a $1500.00 donation to your HSA from the company if you and your spouse get a physical every year.People there are generally friendly| and the cafeterias and break rooms offer a decent variety of food options and places to sit and watch tv while you eat your lunch| of course there are others there only interested in serving their self interests| but overall| the culture is pleasant and there are lots of great people there.","ConsGM is a large company so don't expect to broaden your horizons. You will be corralled into a narrow set of responsibilities| and there are no real opportunities for advancement. You will perform the same repetitive tasks for the rest of your career there. Sure| you can apply internally for different opportunities| but don't expect to get the position. These new opportunities are only posted once the manager has identified the person they want to fill the role| so the interview process is a formality for the pre-selected individual and a facade for all others. Others who apply are out of luck unless the predetermined individual chooses not to accept the new role.My advice to you if you're at GM currently looking for a new role| start brown-nosing and get a manager to submit for a position for you| or look outside the environment. Don't let the ""Golden Handcuffs"" prevent you from looking outside GM for other opportunities either. They are plentiful and often pay better and provide a better overall quality of life / work life balance.No comp time or overtime afforded to those who stay up all night for their manager. The response after a 24 hour shift| some of which is from home is typically ""come in as soon as you can."" IE that next day after 3 hours of sleep.Personally witnessed three people develop heart problems after working for one manager who then required medical leave due to his management style| Described by one of them as ""a monster"".The environment is rife with favoritism and politics.Reviews are 100% corrective| and borderline abusive| so don't expect to ever know what you're doing well| even if you know there should be some positive feedback. If any positive feedback is provided at all| it is presented half handed and disrespectfully as if your efforts accounted for nothing.Per the title| if you qualify under the ADA as a person with a disability| particularly mental| expect no cooperation from your management. HR will require a doctors note for any accommodation request| and if you attempt to circumvent an HR decision about your work situation with an accommodation request from your doctor or complain about your management to the director| despite the zero retaliation policy they say they have| they will target you for termination and find a reason to let you go. They have a team of atty's that will work with HR to find a way to let you go| and block your unemployment and cobra benefits in the process. Simply google ""cobra benefits gross misconduct"" for an example.While my experience with management was terrible| there are very few managers there that are not abusive terror inducing sadists| so you might get lucky. For your health and the benefit of your family| I highly recommend looking elsewhere for employment opportunities. There is plenty of work out there| carpe diem!Senior management is either indifferent to the atrocities of the managers below them or pretends to care| then supports HR in the targeted termination effort.Work Life Balance at GM means you Live to Work. Your family takes a back seat and your children grow up without you in their lives. They will work you to death given the opportunity.",0,,

In addition to leveraging emerging IT technology| GM has invested in creating 'Innovation Centers' across the U.S. where it can hire and retain technical talent to help with this initiative; this helps GM hire talent that is not willing to re-locate to Michigan. GM has great benefits and is an exciting company to work for.,ConsAs with any major transformation there will be some amount of turmoil. In this case it means 'right-sizing' IT to balance support and innovation for the business of manufacturing vehicles. Heavy investments into cloud services| data warehousing technologies| and world-class tools also means working to automate the legacy IT functions; this effort towards automation could mean a lot of operational IT roles will be eliminated at the same time a heavy need for programming and integration will remain a priority.,0,,

They give a pretty good employee discount of their vehicles. I work a okay shift. The work isn't very had.,"ConsWhere do I start. I was offered a job with their subsystems. The health insurance is crappy (no dental or vision). The pay is a joke. The raise is laughable. They have the audacity to give us a employee discount on vehicles| but because of the crappy pay WE can't even afford the cars we make. The union contract for the subsystems is a absolute joke( they should be ashamed of themselves for even negotiating it). They always dangle the real ""GM"" over your head as if they're actually contemplating you ever working for the real GM. High turnover rate.",-1,,

13/4/2016,Great for new college grads,5,Current Employee - Software Development,ProsFor anyone coming right out of college and going into the job market with no practical experience| I highly recommend working with GM. It may take you a few months after starting to get into your rhythm or you may be able to jump right in| depending on how well established the team you are joining is. This is a great place to work toward being a full stack developer. I've been exposed to so many new technologies and processes since I started.All the direct managers| and even their managers that I've interacted with have been really great. I've also gotten lots of advice on how to grow my career with GM. The vacation time is crazy good| and you have unlimited sick days (assuming of course that you are a responsible adult and don't abuse that policy).Working from home/telecommuting is discouraged| and I think this is a pro. Of course| if you are sick| you have a sick kid| or car trouble| something like that then it's fine. I like this because it encourages people to be in the building so you can talk to who you need to and get help in person if needed.,ConsBase salary is at the bottom of the barrel for the new college hire program| but you do get raises every 6 months for the first three years| and there is a yearly bonus as well to consider. Sometimes I can't get my job done in a timely fashion because I have 10 things I need to get done but I'm not allowed to do them myself| and I have to wait for a specific tools team to do them for me| and these teams tend to be swamped with work all the time. It can be pretty frustrating at times. The health insurance is a double edged sword. If you don't need to use it| the low monthly cost is great. If you have a medical condition though| you are stuck paying completely out of pocket until you hit the deductible| which is pretty high.,-6,,

10/4/2016,CREC - Infotainment,1,Current Employee - Software Engineer,Pros- Place that you can get paid while doing nothing.- Good benefit.- 4 days long weekend.,Cons- Incompetent management folks who know nothing about management at all.- Doing only stand up meeting from scrum but nothing else. Management actually don't know what scrum is and what infrastructure is needed to support scrum operation.- Management people have no vision at all. They look busy but they are busy working on something completely unproductive to the team.- Management people never involve in any team activities. They setup scrum meeting which they never attend. They setup weekly seminar which they never attend. They even eat lunch in their own private office. They have no intention at all to involve in any development/team activities.- Management people are show business guy. They spend their effort on things that can plead higher management. However they care nothing about the quality at all. All they want is something to show off. I am sure one day their show will fire back on them due to lack of quality.- Management (all 4 of them) who only spoke to me once during my on board day 6 month ago. No more after that.- All managers suffer from poor English communication problem. I can barely understand what they say in team meeting.- All managers are all from a small circle of friends. They are all friends to each other. That explains why such incompetent guys can do management job because their jobs were gifted rather than earned.,-6,,

There is a severe lack of communication among project teams (PMs will schedule you to do tasks and then not even send out the schedule).

More importantly| there are many different opportunities within the company to move into if you position yourself correctly.,ConsIn the past few years| the company has been driven hard to meet or exceed targets (volume| profitability| etc.).

Very slow and bureaucratic. IT ""innovation"" is just a word used to mask the real issues going on. The work culture has not caught up with the times either. As an older millennial you'd think I'd be OK with their management style or jaded enough to not care but the fact is that the culture is just way too old school and it runs deep. In Austin| this may be due to the fact that most folks in management come from old school tech staples such as IBM| Dell| HP| etc OR they come from old industrial management mindset in Detroit. It is all about metrics and feel good numbers| very low actual productivity. Also| depending on the manager you get| you could be easily micromanaged and really bogged down by process and inflexibility.Creative and motivated developers stay away! This is where your development skills come to die and where your spreadsheet and powerpoint skills are dusted off and given new life.I give it a D grade when it comes to culture and quality of work for software developers and database professionals.

I've been told that the average age of a designer/engineer at GM was 52 a few years ago| this caused senior managment to hire a large number of younger| educated| employees to be trained for the inevietable retirement of a large portion of GM's workforce. While the overall majority of employees are helpful and receptive of new hires| a large minority of this older generation of employees are extremely resistant (maybe threatened?) by the influx of younger people. They often refuse to even consider the opinion/advice/suggestion of an ""entitled millennial""| this makes for a very uncomfortable work environment.

I've seen many people who learn they are changing roles from a department-wide email which feels very impersonal and makes you feel out of control over your career.Maternity/Paternity leave policies are underwhelming.Instead of telling employees actual expectations| management lies to you with ""stretch goals"" because they assume you will fail to meet the actual timeline. I understand why people do this| but it makes me feel like a child. Multiple times| I worked super-late hours to meet their false timeline only to learn that it wasn't due for another few days.

Makes decisions take forever to socialize or get agreement on. Very easy to get stuck with a low salary if you come in on an entry level job. HR and mgmt won't necessarily bump you to your market range for your job. You may have to wait YEARS to catch up. Lots of ""old boys"" network crap to deal with and especially in IT you have factions of people working to own as much IT as they can internally versus helping and cooperating on projects. Very inflexible work location policy. If you like small cubes with no privacy or sound barrier| then you've found GM's definition of ""innovation"". Getting in and out of the complex is a nightmare. There's a commute to get to campus and another commute and walk once you get there. CEO lets the IT Pres run wild as he builds his own factions away from the Detroit headquarters.",-2,,

If you are smart you will gather experience and knowledge so that other doors can open.,ConsHaving worked there a couple of years ago and left due to the bureaucracy and the insecurity of some ex DELL members| I landed a year later at GM again but in a different state: great staff| amazing professionals| excellent work ethics| and with a higher position than what I had in Austin (despite the bullying I received). I went through the background check and my new office new I had worked for IT. Five months later into the new job and with excellent feedback from my superiors| I started to receive phone calls from ex coworkers at IT. That was it. The minute IT Austin management new I had a higher position than themselves| it all went south| even against my current supervisors. Somewhere somehow there is power in Austin which is the reason why they have such negative reviews and GN in other states considers Austin a waste in GM. I have already done my great review to the other department| this being said| please know that not all GM is like 'innovation'Austin. Thanks to GM OUTSIDE of Austin| the great people I met in the automotive industry and their recommendations| I now have a better job geared towards my career and goals.,-1,,

14/1/2016,Typical large cooperation,2,Current Employee - Software Developer,ProsThe people at General Motors are generally great to work with. There's a strong push to hire lots of college graduates| which can make the environment fun and filled with new ideas.The work/life balance is generally OK at General Motors. I don't find myself having to work too excessively most of the time| but it could be better.Some of the compensation are good. Vacation is lengthy even for those fresh out of school| 401k matching is excellent| and healthcare is about on par with other companies. Additionally| GM employees get discounts on new GM products.Great place to work if you are well established or at the end of your career.,"ConsUnfortunately| many of the pro's listed are also cons in their own way.Because the working environment is often very young| you're left with many inexperienced| college level employees| and the rest tend to be older managers far removed from the work they oversee. There seems to be a large gap in the middle| somewhere to turn to for advice or guidance with the everyday work.Recently the work/life balance has started to trend downwards. When I first started the idea was ""Work as much as needed to get your work done."" In IT| this works well. When we were busy| we would work as much as needed to complete the task| and then when things slowed down we might have only had to work 5 or 6 hours a day. Additionally| working from home was accepted. Over the past 6 months or so there has been a very strong push to ensure everyone is in the office 8-9 hours a day| regardless of workload. This can lead to sitting around on your hands or not getting your work done in a timely manner because everyone clocks out at 5 PM.Compensation in some areas is well below par for new hires. The salary for my field is roughly 25% lower than at a less successful company 2 miles down the road. GM tries to push the ""benefits package"" to avert your attention from this in the form of bonuses| but those are entirely company dependent and can easily fail to supplement the lack of a competitive salary. It seems they continue to attempt to lower this bonus each year as well.Credit is generally granted to the manager overseeing the work you did entirely on your own. General Motors is a very old company that tends to treat its executives significantly better than its underlings. Successes on projects and endeavours are usually seen as managerial successes and come with bonuses to the manager rather than rewarding the employee. There are plenty of internal programs set up to remedy this| none of which are utilized.Moving up in the company can take an eternity. When a position you seek opens up on your team| it's advisable to talk to your manager (or whoever is responsible) immediately about this opening you seek| but don't expect any resolution for possible years to come.",-10,,

20/1/2016,Stay away from Warren Tech Center for GMIT positions for New College Graduates,1,Current Employee - Software Developer,ProsGreat benefits. Generous time off. Great discounts on GM vehicles. Great relocation package.,"ConsThe hiring process was an absolute nightmare. Received a job offer that I had to accept in 14 days. Sent questions to GM. Did not hear from GM until 35 days later. Scheduling my move| getting information about my new position| and any related onboarding information took weeks to acquire. This is not uncommon with GM. GM will hire thousands of New College Graduates (NCG) who will all get automatically funneled to one hiring rep (computer error). This one person is then unable to respond to the needs of the NCG's and the NCG's are left in the dust while they are making an important life decision.Few opportunities to move across organizations (GMIT to GM or vice versa). I have been told several times by GMIT employees that it is easier to quit and reapply to GM than to move across organizations. If you attempt to get another job in the area| better hope they do not have an agreement with GM to not hire former GM employees.Management style in Warren| MI is old and outdated. The staff at the Warren Tech Center are not prepared to work with NCG's and if you are a new college graduate| stay away from Warren. Management does not communicate well with NCG's. Your IT training may be months after employment start date and for months you may have little to no work. Concerns raised to management are dismissed; likely no action will be taken by management. This may then be used against you during your end of year review. Management may brush your concerns aside and basically say ""put a smile on and do your work"".I have a degree in a non-software related field and am trying to move into the vehicle side of GM| but have been met with resistance when discussing this with management. My team is comprised mostly of long time workers who are not trying to develop their careers anymore| so career development is not a focus for the team and therefore is pushed to the wayside when NCG's want to develop their careers.Performance is not determined by the work you produce but how others perceive you.GMIT work is done entirely in front of a computer| but there are almost zero opportunities to work from home. It is highly frowned upon and only done under special circumstances.The great benefits are not worth the struggle you will experience being hired and working for GMIT. Stay away.",0,,

And my management is happy to support me and enables me to be ambitious and take risks.Everyone in the engineering staff truly feels we can design the best car a customer could ever wish for.

Overall| what was once one of the worst companies to work for is now the best.,"ConsGM has over 200|000 employees. You have to be willing to work with people otherwise you will get nothing done. In addition| GM has a huge corporate landscape with dozens of tools and processes that one must conquer. GM has made improvements in its orientation training material but expect no golden handbook on how to do your job. You must be independent| willing to ask questions| and ready to learn.It will take time for GM to completely change its corporate culture. I reference GM's culture as a pro but there is still a large minority that remain as ""old GM."" These are the people who look to do the bare minimum to get by. They take little pride in their work and they are thinking their home improvement job rather than their work. GM set subpar employee standards; therefore| these employees will remain.",-3,,

Insane amount of beauracracy and red tape. Heavily silo-ed environment where teams focus on only one small piece of the puzzle and refuse to help with anything outside their area of expertise. Developing any application requires multiple meetings with multiple teams who often block anything that falls outside dictated standards. Hardware requests can take months and require multiple meetings with architects who push back on every request. Reactive mentality to only increase hardware resources when problems occur rather than a proactive mentality to prevent those problems in the first place.

They hired 130 new hires out of college for 2014. You do not have the option to work from home. GM also has a culture of pretending to be busy| they don't exactly assign you too much work or provide adequate mentorship/supervision.

25/8/2015,Unethical company| recall coverups| kickback heavy| poor direction,1,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsMary Barra but too little too late,ConsDisorganized company even since they regrouped after 2008. Faulty ignitions not replaced in many of the Ambassador program vehicles as they continue to let employee's use them. IT is very inefficient and require too much red tape. Very silo-ed environment. Managers are a joke. Many come from Dell which should explain quite a bit. GM was sued by HP for exiting a large contract early and the penalty is to replace much of existing vendors equipment with HP equipment. Many unnecessary resource hours and efforts due to the suit. Poor way to run a business. Think of Office Space on an extremely large scale. Resource on-boarding is a joke| you are truly just a number. Coffee is not free but that is the least of your worries if you work for Government Motors. Nepotism is high| especially in upper management. I've heard kickbacks are common although I personally cannot confirm but with many of the strange business relationships you do have to wonder.Austin has many many better suited companies. Don't work for GM and expect lots communication and acceptance to new ideas and no personal satisfaction at the end of the day. Many clicks in the environment which is very immature. The title GM Innovation Center is a true joke| zero innovation as they don't want your opinions rather just do the job their old school ways without being receptive to new ideas. They can leave their crappy Detroit business ethics back in Detroit| should not be in Austin. Don't be tricked by the bells and whistles there| stop and think about if you want to advance your career with a good ethical company or a sleazy one. They are also clock watchers. If you just want an ordinary 9-5 job| not a true career then GM is your place. Morale is very low with the newer employees. The honeymoon phase is very short at GM once you realize how they truly operate. I will never own another GM vehicle again; will not support this company in anyway.,-3,,

Too many accountants had G.M. lose its identity as a design and engineering leader and they lost their role as a world leader in manufacturing. Ike| I believe| once said that whatever was good for GM was good for the country. I wish Mary Barra well,ConsWhen the U.S. government became the leader of General Motors we were unsure of what was next. People were being released for obscure reasons and were replaced by people not familiar with manufacturing. The Lake Orion| Mi. plant| that produced the Chevt Malibu and Pontiac G6 - both great selling vehicles - was closed and gutted by government demand and replaced by the slow selling Chevy Sonic. Both the Pontiac and Saturn name plates were gone. The Pontiac models sold well and Saturn finally had a design that moved people to their show rooms.

You are forced to work the most undesirable jobs in your facility that nobody else wants and you are very much encouraged not to try and take time off| because essentially you are there for absence relief.

Perhaps there is a place at GM you would like but I caution you my experience wasn't an outlier.-Lock-in policies. When I decided to quit I found that GM has agreements with most of their suppliers and all of the contracting companies they work with to not hire GM employees. When I asked my supervisor if he could be my reference for an apartment I was told that GM has a strict no reference policy. That's right as far as auto industry was concerned I was stuck as a GM employee and even if I did get out professionally I'd have nothing to show for it.. For this reason alone| I would highly recommend never joining this company for any amount of time.-Motivation Draining. The time I work at GM was some of the worst time of my life. I had money but that didn't matter. I spent it on anything that would make me forget about the work day. My work time was spent on facebook| listening to music| reading comics| and basically anything that I could do to waste time. I was told to write a spec but not told what it was about| what to put in it| or even who to contact to find out. When I'd ask my supervisor he'd give me some pointless task for me to spin my wheels on for a few days. When I did get ""real work"" it would be ridiculous stuff like reading a 1000+ page book| converting 10000+ line excel documents into XML| or the details on a spec I had to write in 2 days.. Learn from my experience. Do not waste your time here.-Unfriendly Corporate Culture. Upon entering the building there were hundreds of nameless faces that would pass by without a glance in my direction. After awhile| I thought this was normal. This alone has scarred my social interaction. I'm still trying to be comfortable with giving people a polite hello while walking past them.-Absurd Limitations. During my time at GM| I found it difficult to even get the basic resources I needed to do my job. I requested a network drive of 250MB in size so that a coworker and I could share code. To GM's credit| I received a approval email but that email came with no instructions on how to access the drive. Of course| what we needed was a Git| SVN| or CVS server but I was told that it would take at least 2 years to get permission for such a luxury.-No Aesthetic Values. If you enjoy working in a grey cubical at the end of a grey hall with sparse pictures of GM brand cars on the walls day in and day out. This is the place for you! If you enjoy looking at grass| gravel| and parking lots while taking a walk at lunch. This is the place for you! If you enjoy easy excess to lovely restaurants like ""Red Cactus Grill""| ""SoupZone""| and ""Home Zone"" then please read no more and sign yourself up for a low stress and unmeaningful career.-Poorly Located.

As a temporary employee| you are a floater and are continually moved around to different areas and jobs on the line which doesn't allow you to become fully efficient at the jobs you're on.

The IT is mainly controlled by contractors turned GM employees mostly Indians and they don't have any clue at all other than taking a small thing and blow it up. GPSC is so corrupted that Indian Managers are even taking a bribe in India so that they can bring 10s of worthless contractors for nothing| The contractors don't have anything to do but GPSC managers have been taking money under the table so they have to protect or defend their wrongdoing. If someone complains then that person will be retaliated right away. HR is just a joke and they are aligned with the managers| or they don't have any clue.

GM was always willing to lend me hand when a problem occurred by having the right manager or leader come to help.

30/3/2015,Great Pay & Benefits| Bad Management,2,Former Employee - Skilled Trades,ProsThe pay & benefits are good.,ConsThe working conditions in the manufacturing facility are dirty| dangerous and generally unhealthy. Overtime is mandatory and can last for years. Some people love it and want the money| other people would like to have a life| but regardless of what you would like| you MUST be there. If you are told to work 70hrs/week for 3 years| you have to do it. I personally prefer to live my life outside of work| so that didn't settle well with me.The longtime management vs. union conflict make working relationships incredibly stressful. Management treats union members as if they were the enemy and the union returns the same energy back. It is a working dynamic that is exhausting and incredibly frustrating.,0,,

If you do not start your job before April| you are not eligible for a pay raise next year| even if you work your butt off. So if you start at April 2015| you will not get a pay raise until April 2017. HR should be more transparent about this| because that is essentially a pay cut. So if you are considering taking an offer| you need to take this into consideration and/or after your final offer| bring up this topic and ask for an additional several percentage increase.People are not held accountable for their work| and the work ends up going to those who have work ethic and technical knowledge. It's hard to fire people. The burden is on you to document their incompetence. And even when you do that| they would rather move the person to another team than to deal with HR.GM is starting to hire a lot of new college hires. It appears their strategy is to hire a lot of experienced people and throw a lot of money to incentives them to join. It's not easy to insource your entire IT operations so you need to pay people enough to deal with all the BS that comes along with off shored contractors. For example| the off shored contractors are not cooperative when it comes to knowledge transfers. We even have applications that do not have source code and we are forced to decompile the source code! Are the people who ran the projects previously held accountable? Nope| you just deal with it and make it work.Now that a lot of the hard work is done| their are hiring a lot of college new hires. They don't pick from top universities with strong engineering programs. GM seems to value EEO and hire from a lot of HBCU...more than I see from other companies. On a few teams I know of| there is on average a 1:1 ratio of experienced engineers to college hires. Some teams more| some teams less. But you will be spending a lot of time hand holding the new hires. Not only are some of them incompetent| but lack professionalism| such as coming in late| long lunches| missing meetings| sleeping on the job.In my opinion| once IT is full in-sourced| GM will start laying off the experienced engineers in hopes the new college hires who are paid a lot less will be able to take over. So if your are considering an offer| you should ask how many direct college hires are on your team and how many are experienced.Very little small perks. Bring your own coffee or pay $1.50...The company has no license for wireframe tool| so get use to using Microsoft Paint. No Christmas celebration or little perks to boost morale...just come in and work.Poor planning. I work in the Georgia Innovation Center. They've poorly planned the hiring process. People are stacked on top of each other| forced to share desks. We ended up renting a facility 15 minutes north| in Cumming to relieve the situation. Wifi is so slow because of the amount of people and poor infrastructure planning. If you can't plan for things you know will happen| how can you plan for things that you know won't happen? From an informal poll| most people live south of the facility so this is more time the company is taking away from you. Other companies I know are moving in town..GM...15 minutes further north. Myself and who joined before me did not have monitors docking stations for several months because of poor planning. Still currently only have 1 monitor.Even though they call the centers Innovation Centers| your job really is to take over and maintain poor performing| buggy old applications. And don't even bring up rewriting anything| no one wants to bring GM to 2015.The managers are generally non technical. Don't bother asking them what framework their apps use. If you ask them Spring or Struts| they'll think you're talking about the suspension system of a car. Ask them a question on PowerPoint| they can answer that.You have unlimited sick days. What this means is| you only take an entire day off if you are on your death bed. Other wise you work from home.Everything is slow. Need access to something? Fill out a ticket and wait a week.

It all depends on your specific organization| manager| and etc. I hope to only include elements that apply to all GM employees. GM has a fair and transparent stance on many things including compensation and job opportunities. That impresses me. Salaried employees are given information on their current salary vs the market rate| what level they are| etc. The job opportunity awareness program gives employees a shot of the hundreds of jobs available any given day.,ConsThe IT organization is going the micro-management route with tickets| time monitoring| etc. Makes you feel like you are not trusted.,-2,,

The reality is much of the work in the immediate term and next 5 years will be cleaning up the mess of decades of contractors and poor coding standards.Some managers and departments are blatantly abusing college hires. When hired| these employees are put into a special bucket with decent raises for the first three years. In some instances these employees are given lead responsibilities (or the whole ROLE) and expected to perform at that level. For those that can handle the additional work it is a great opportunity. Unfortunately they receive the same wage and raises as their non-lead college hires counterparts. HR does not allow these employees who take on higher role work and excel at it to be reclassified and given proper compensation.,-8,,

As a result a lot of employees if they hit that level comparatively early in their career and get stuck in the same level for few years end up becoming very mediocre and unenthusiastic at work.* A lot of unnecessary meetings and there is a culture to ""look busy"".* Very bureaucratic - Too many useless processes to get simple things done.* Most of the time work is not challenging as automotive industry is not as fast paced as some of the other industries.* Very few things to do in Michigan.",-7,,

Many mangers are from AMD| Dell and HP and seem to leave nothing but destruction in their wake.What this means is that your manager| or even your director| cannot approve the simplest requests or really authorize any kind of expense no matter how small.

It is a clean manufacturing environment| and most jobs require a reasonable amount of focus/effort/dexterity. I enjoyed my time there.,ConsI was able to try a few different jobs on the assembly line| and some were very difficult| even with all the advances in technology over the years. Some were simply still not ergonomically designed and could really lead to repetitive use injuries| so I definitely think ALL of the jobs in the plant should be designed so the part fits well/slides on easily or does not require really awkward bending of the wrist while using a power tool| because the wrist is an easily damaged area.,0,,

All that is left are employees willing to design| build| and sell the worlds best vehicle.- Everyone is passionate about GM products. Very few drive non-GM vehicles.- Great perks. If you work engineering| then most likely you be driving NextGen vehicles to home and work. 401k perks. Health perks. Vacation Perks (up to 30 days if you work there long enough).. etc..- Auto industry is moving at an insane pace. Very exciting time to be in the industry (NextGen infotainment| hybrid and electric| Passive safety systems| etc.). Plus| cars are cool! People hang posters of cars. You probably have some sort of personal connection to your car (love it or hate it kind or relationship). Your friends most likely care more about the auto industry rather than the cell phone or server industry.- Your work is important. Any changes you make to a vehicle are seen by 10 million customers a year.- Challenging work. The car is easily the most complex thing you own (100's of sensors| multiple computers| variety of serial comm| extreme heat and shock exposure| engine controls| crash proof| radar| etc.)- GM just started a 5 year glide path to management (higher education (MS and MBA)| exposure to multiple engineering arenas| engineering roles (programmer| program manager| release engineer| etc.)- Overall| very an excellent place to go to work.","ConsBefore| I get into the cons| lets remind ourselves of the obvious... GM has over 200|000 employees at 390 facilities globally. Now lets begin- I am pretty sure GM invented and maintains the definition of corporate culture. You are going to have lots of emails and lots of meetings. You have to be a people person. Get used to working with a variety of personalities.- If you are the type of person that ""assumes"" work is getting done| it is not. You need to be vigilant at GM and remind co-workers of their duties.- GM seems old. Physically| there are a lot near retired employees. Young people are starting to show up.- GM is like a large university. There is no hand holding. Once you show up| you have to figure out everything yourself. Teach yourself engineering principles| corporate structure| etc.- It is a very 7:30 - 4:30 job. Expect to work those hours... By 6:00pm the place is a ghost town.- Again| GM is big. You are the employee whom work hard and does everything that their management ask for... you are not going to get promoted. Everyone does that. You need to stand out| write patents| change positions that have exposure. You need to be strategic. No one ever gets promoted in a linear fashion.- Health benefits needs to be improved. Deductible is way too high.",-5,,

And you will get the support you need to in order to make the changes you envision.- The company is very flexible in helping you deal with life events that come up.- In my time there I have not observed anything ""evil"" about the company - they are in it for the long haul| they want to do the right thing and not cut corners just because customers might not notice. GM seems to have a strong corporate conscience| even if it means we have to sacrifice profits in the short term.- The work culture is overall good - the managers are trained to resolve disputes and to conduct themselves fairly. They care about your career| prod you to try to define where you want to go| then they help you to get there.","Cons- The weather in Michigan isn't for everyone.- It often feels like there are many ""silos"" within GM| and engineering work / findings are not shared readily and transparently among the engineering teams. Frequently redundant work is done simply because team B wasn't aware that team A had already done that work. Information is not organized| shared| and made searchable.",-3,,

If you are lucky to be in a good group| you get to do interesting work. For a Mechanical Engineer| cars are among the most interesting things to work on. Detroit suburbs are boring but have many good schools| affordable housing and the state of Michigan is home to good universities.,"ConsGM is a company to become a ""one trick pony."" Most employees end up doing the same stuff year after year. It is important to be placed in an important product development group. Otherwise| career can quickly become meaningless.

Most mid level management are good people to work for in your functional area. Salary is typically good to better than most| and the benefits are top notch as they have always been.,ConsThe bureaucracy in product development rivals the government. The rigidness to standards and procedures can be overwhelming. The manufacturing side of engineering whines more than a motor with a bad bearing. Most manufacturing/assembly personnel are very unwilling to try anything new or push the envelope. Most of upper level management is out of touch with what is really going on in the new programs. There is little to no opportunity for advancement unless you find it yourself - and even the HR and management will tell you that as well.,-3,,

19/2/2013,Worst employment experience ever-Avoid,2,Former Employee - Group Leader (Production Supervisor/Foreman),ProsCompetitive salary and benefits. Those are the only Pros.,"ConsTurnover is extremely high in the Group Leader position at the Lordstown location. Training is minimal and does not prepare you to work on the floor. Union employees have too much power and many will make your life hell just for the fun of it. Team Leaders (union employees in charge of a group of other union employees) are supposed to assist the GL and run their teams| problem solve| etc. leaving the GL to manage operations at a higher level| however| they and their team members still work under the assumption that they are ""Coordinators"" whose only jobs are to give ""e-breaks"" (bathroom breaks) and to fix mistakes as they arise. Many will use giving e-breaks as an excuse to avoid other work. Rather than fix problems as they arise (ex. contact electricians or maintenance)| they will try to pass the buck to their GL's. In effect| Group Leaders are unable to do their own work and are stuck doing their own jobs plus that of the TL's. Expect to work over (unpaid| of course) at least one hour per day in order to complete paperwork and any other issues that arose. You will not be able to stay in your office for more than 5 minutes at a time. You will literally run up and down your area responding to help calls and alarms for 9 hours a day. You will also be expected to come in| at minimum| 30 minutes before the start of the shift (usually 1 hr if your Superintendent likes a pre-work meeting). When hourly employees get their ten minute breaks twice a day| you will not. You will most likely have a meeting. When they get their 20 minute lunches| you will likely not. Expect to be hungry| have sore feet and back| and be tired on a daily basis. Also| as soon as you get used to an area and it is running smoothly| you will be moved to another area or shift.",-7,,
