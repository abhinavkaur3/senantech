There is a lot asked from the technician| and a lot of responsibility placed on his shoulders. Volkswagen| pays slightly more than other brands| and the continuity between dealerships is pretty good. Just be ready for a lot of feast or famine scenarios.,ConsThe cons are most definitely the famine months of the winter. Industry slows down| people drive less| and you get fewer cars in for repairs. The dealership does nothing to mitigate this famine for the technician| because you are flat-rate.,0,

16/1/2015,Bureaucratic & traditional company| but offers some good opportunities.,3,Former Employee - Anonymous Employee,ProsIf you're passionate about cars| then that's one of the companies to go to. You might get an opportunity to improve or change future cars. They take care of the workers rights| like a regulated working week and enough holidays. My tasks were interesting and I was challenged| so I have learned a lot when I left the company.,ConsIt is a very traditional company with high hierarchies. A lot of interns are hired| more than I've ever seen in any other company before. Also their wages were below what I have experienced at other companies and not many of the interns are actually hired after their internship.,0,

3/12/2014,Learned a LOT!,5,Current Employee - Intern,ProsAs your managers are all seniors they are just an awesome source of knowledge and inspiration. I think the management used in Volkswagen by some managers is just brillant as they try to put you at the best of your performance. you will participate all the travels and most the car dealer network visits and these kind of things. Today I can say that I gained in maturity and changed a part of how I was working. Also the end of the months is an exciting moment to live in the automotive industry.,ConsUnfortunately i would say that the hiring policy is very strict and depends on your top managers if they heard about you. Work hard and might have a change to be rewarded| knowing that a recommendation from the top managment in Volkswagen group is worth a lot if you apoly somwhere else.,0,

VW also has a great offering for manual transmissions.,ConsExtremely difficult to get time off| especially on weekends - also mandatory long shifts such as at least one 12 hour day per week| no overtime| and commissions may be based on surveys from sales and service customers. Also| Volkswagen currently does not have a 3rd row vehicle| and they typically are a more expensive vehicle with less features than most competitors,0,

Good benefits. Great location.,ConsTerrible hours. HIGHLY QUESTIONABLE LEADERSHIP. Stohlman service managers create a hostile work environment and verbally assault their employees (LAWSUIT TIME-BOMB). Cost-cutting and profit-bloating rampant. They hire and fire weekly.

One can receive a great level of experience and self-development within this company and is also being supported strongly with regards to further staff developments by HR.,ConsWhile the company is still quite young and continuously developing itself| one can in some cases also notice still some minor areas that still require further development| especially with regards to certain process standards| which may sometimes cause some trouble in the daily life.,0,
