,Alfa Romeo  is my passion my drive I can't say enough to my customers about the cars . I tell them  they must  take a test drive before price shopping them. So they too can fall in love as I have with the brand. And I will say 98% of the time they walk out same day with a car. We let the car sell itself .Anjanette Futie’s comment

, Giovani siate imprenditori di voi stessi i grandi gruppi sono politicizzati e nella gran parte trovate ai primi livello parenti amici e affini di politici e sindacati. Lavoro nel gruppo FCA dal 1997 entrai come operaio nel 2000 mi spostarono in ufficio 2001 gestivo magazzino materie prime 2002 logistica 2005 responsabile logistica dal 2006 al 2010 controller di stabilimento. Morale della favola gente che non sapeva fare nemmeno la O col bicchiere erano capi e quadri io nel 2012 ho dovuto fare vertenza all azienda e tuttora in attesa di appello dopo 12 anni ancora inquadrato come operaio. Grazie anche ai capi del personale che badavano più alla vendita dei posti di lavoro.

,"porto a conoscenza che da oggi svolgerò nuova mansione,"
,pertanto vorrei salutare e ringraziare (chi lo merita ) le persone che in questi 4 anni (poco più poco meno)
,ho avuto modo di conoscere.
,Poiché il mondo lavorativo attuale non rispecchia le svariate teorie che nell’arco della vita
,apprendiamo con lo studio e con l’esperienza a riguardo di meritocrazia e crescita professionale.
,Me ne  ritorno al passato fiero di non avere più contatti diretti con alcuni personaggi che rispetto ma non stimo
,"tornando indietro di 10 anni per andare a svolgere il mio nuovo incarico di addetto al ricevimento merci,"
,"non mi prolungo prima perché ci vorrebbero ore , secondo perché per molti non ne vale la pena."
, 
,Saluto e ringrazio col cuore i pochi che lo meritano
, 
,p.s quindi da oggi non inviate richieste inerenti al lavoro di controllo gestione
,  vi comunico inoltre che se il mio legale ritenesse necessario potreste essere chiamati a testimoniare a riguardo.

Sure, you will blame it on something else, but it will be for no other reason than the fact that you killed off the Dodge Grand Caravan and the Chrysler Town & Country, some of the best selling cars in America across ALL brands. Not sure what kind of genius made this decision, but the new Pacifica is no replacement to these two solid icons. A real shame. This would be equivalent to BMW destroying the M3 identity.

," There is a need for clean energy vehicles where the tailpipe is True Zero emissions to sing and dance about a 2% cut in emissions is a joke. If this is the best that FCA can do when they have all the expertise of Ferrari from F1 then they deserve to fail like Kodak.My suggestion is to pull down your wall to innovation, accept that the answer may well be in Open Innovation, carry out DD on my HyPulJet.2.0 Hydrogen Rotary Engine-generator for EVs concept. The BIG difference, I am confident that this engine will have its own own on board the EV fuel production.Southampton University have assessed the documentation contained in the three Patent applications covering this revolutionary engine and they have decided that the description and drawing covering the design, processes and methods are Plausible.That does not include assessment of the fuel production unit, which in reality is a bolt on and deliberately not included in the Patents as there are any number of such units available and a different system would have allowed a design around.  …see morecharles alvin scott’s comment"

," 40th birthday present Grand Jeep Cherokee, totally written off 800 miles, within 3 months of getting it.  Car had been parked and no one was in it thank god, fire service say it was a wiring short.  Jeep have a lot to answer for, they are trying to say the fire happened in the middle of the car behind the passenger seats with an ignition source that is not there anymore ...which doesn't correlate to what the fire investigators said or to these pictures!! New MD at Jeep but sadly Ashley Andrew has no time for minions like me who have invested hard earned money buying into their products.
