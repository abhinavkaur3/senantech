The new Citroen Grand C4 Picasso is a seven-seat version of the sharply-styled, five-seat C4 Picasso. It’s spacious, comfortable and looks great, while providing all the versatility required for a family car. There’s a good range of engines on offer, too, providing a good balance between economy and performance.

The latest Civic is a real contender in the family hatchback class, and with the standard of the opposition, that’s really saying something. It’ll keep you comfortable and entertained in equal measure, and the entry-level petrol engine is great on both performance and economy. It’s not the poshest-feeling hatchback, and it’s a little limited on practicality, but if you can live with that, the Civic should definitely be on your shopping list.
",There's a lot of competition in the family hatchback class. Can the new Honda Civic hold its own?

As a stylish and practical family car, with good-value prices and the added versatility of four-wheel drive on many models, the Tucson has a lot going for it. We do have a few reservations, especially about the efficiency and performance of the best-selling 1.7-litre diesel, so we’d recommend that buyers who are tempted by this sort of car also look at a Nissan Qashqai or Skoda Yeti.

The price alone makes the Sandero a hugely attractive car, but when you throw in all its other attributes – the low running costs and the space inside, for example – it creates a package that will doubtless appeal to many buyers.

Don’t think for one moment that the latest Civic Type R is simply an evolution of its predecessor. Thanks to an all-new body that’s lighter, stiffer, wider, longer and lower – and tied to the road using a much more sophisticated suspension – the new car displays poise and agility, and provides levels of driver interaction, that the previous car could only dream of. It’s still crazily quick, but it’s also far more refined and far more comfortable, and the driving position is light years better than before. Together, these comprehensive changes have transformed the Type R from a brutal, no-compromise hot hatchback into a car that offers stunning performance and exhilarating handling alongside everyday usability and comfort. 
","The latest Type R still looks bonkers, but it’s no longer a one-dimensional back street hero. Instead, it’s a simply stunning 21st century hyper-hatch and a worthy rival to the Focus RS and the Volkswagen Golf R."

The Renegade is a worthy addition to the congested compact SUV class. For buyers with a focus on off-road ability, space and practicality, and a fun sense of personality, it offers something different from the norm. However, high prices, refinement issues and a firm, bouncy ride make it harder to recommend to everyday family buyers.
","The Jeep Renegade is the brand's smallest SUV yet, aimed at younger buyers and small families, with serious off-road ability, and priced to rival the Skoda Yeti and Mini Countryman"
www.autotrader.co.uk,Jaguar',Paul Bond,Jaguar XE Saloon (2015 - ) review,Last updated: 24th April 2015,4.0,"Superb handling balance,Efficient diesel engines,Stylish and aerodynamic exterior","Cramped rear seats,Some interior finishes are rather dour,Diesels aren’t the quietest and manual gearshift is notchy",,"
The Jaguar XE is worthy of serious consideration for anyone searching for their next compact saloon. It scores highly for both its sleek looks and efficient diesel engines, but its biggest attraction is that it’s absolutely sensational to drive. It comes better equipped than most of its rivals, featuring all the latest safety gadgets, and is one of the only executive cars which emits just 99g/km of CO2, meaning super-low tax bills. The only downsides are some issues with practicality and rather disappointing interior quality.
","The Jaguar XE saloon is a cracking addition to the compact-executive club. Class-leading efficiency and emissions, alongside an engaging drive are the plus points, but concerns remain around practicality and interior quality"

The Hyundai i20 is cracking value for money, providing lots of space and standard equipment for a very competitive price. It’s also easy to drive and affordable to run and, thanks to a generous warranty, should be fairly painless to own. Granted, it has a few flaws, but it should still be near the top of any supermini buyer’s shortlist.
","The Hyundai i20 is a low-cost, high-value supermini that competes with cars like the Skoda Fabia. It comes with loads of standard kit and has really impressive interior space."

Beautiful, dynamically engaging and efficient enough to justify to yourself and your bank manager, the XF certainly has a lot going for it. With a bigger boot and less cramped rear seats than the XE, we’d also argue that the XF is the pick of Jaguar’s pair of sleek executive saloons. Strong resale values, low insurance and generous kit all play their part in making this one of the best big execs around.
","The Jaguar XF has a tough task taking on established saloons from Audi, BMW and Mercedes, but its looks, efficient engines and sharp handling all set it apart"

The Jaguar F-Pace can rightly claim to be one of the sportiest and best-looking SUVs on the market. It's handsome, practical, and surprisingly cheap to run when fitted with a 2.0-litre diesel engine. This might be the brand's first ever 4x4, but Jaguar has borrowed technical know-how from sister brand Land Rover and the result is a car that feels rugged off-road and comfortable - yet poised - on it.

The Jaguar XJ is a charming alternative to the benchmark in this class, the Mercedes S-Class. It looks sleeker and drives sharper than the big Mercedes, but can't quite compete when it comes to space, luxury, and the latest technology. Still, it's definitely worth looking at if you're after a high-speed cruiser for covering long distances, and the entry-level diesel models are fantastic value.

The i30 is not short of appeal, especially if you value comfort over dynamic prowess. It’s not the most engaging thing to drive, however, and it’s certainly not what you’d consider eye-candy, thanks to its styled-by-committee, Euro-box shape. That said, it’s well-equipped, spacious, attractively priced, and comes with the reassurance of a five-year/unlimited mileage, no-quibble warranty. Unfortunately, the i30 is far from a pace setter. It’s nowhere close to the last word in quality or driving pleasure, and we could probably think of at least half a dozen rivals that do almost everything the i30 does, and a whole lot more besides.
",The i30 is Hyundai’s challenger to some of the best family cars on the planet. It’ll need to be seriously good to match the likes of the Volkswagen Golf and Vauxhall Astra.

The Ioniq is the most convincing challenger to the market leading Toyota Prius and Nissan Leaf thus far, and in many respects, it’s a better proposition than both those cars. While the Hybrid Ioniq is more enjoyable to drive and has a plusher interior than the Prius, much of the same praise can be levelled at the all-electric Ioniq, which also offers stronger performance and a greater range than the Leaf. ,Because of the way hybrids and electric vehicles operate, the Ioniq will still have limited appeal to long-distance commuters – those folk will definitely be better served by diesel power – but for urbanites and Uber cab drivers, the Ioniq could usher in an exciting new dawn.
",The Ioniq is the first car in the world to be launched with three different electrified powertrains. Toyota Prius and Nissan Leaf owners should definitely take note.

The Infiniti Q30 has some pretty serious flaws, particularly with its practicality, its ownership costs and its balance of ride and handling. When it’s up against rivals with the incredible all-round ability of the Audi A3 Sportback and BMW 1 Series, we find it very difficult to recommend.

Like the Q30 on which it’s based, the Infiniti QX30 SUV has some pretty serious flaws, particularly with its practicality and its balance of ride and handling. Thing is, the QX30 also happens to be a lot more expensive than its sister car, which makes it even more difficult for us to recommend.

The Infiniti Q60 looks good and is exceptionally well equipped, but in just about every other respect, it’s comprehensively outgunned by rivals like the Audi A5, BMW 4 Series and Mercedes C-Class Coupe.

The Civic Type R is a good hot hatch that was so nearly a great one. It’s fast, fun and frenetic, and it really encourages you to treat it mean and drive it hard. However, steering that’s both numb and at times unpredictable thanks to significant torque steer takes the shine off the driving experience, which is the whole point of a hot hatch. It has some fairly fundamental flaws in other key areas, too, so unfortunately, this car is an also-ran in the ultra-competitive hot hatch sector.
","The Honda Civic Type R has big shoes to fill, such was the success of its predecessors. It’s great in isolation, but less impressive when compared with its super-talented rivals"

Overall, the Honda Civic is a decent car with plenty going for it. There are quite a few small, niggly things wrong with it, but they don’t ruin the experience overall. Not the cheapest car of its type, but it should prove to be decent value long-term.

The Citroen C4 is meant to be all about comfort, but its dated chassis fails to deliver on any score. It rides and handles poorly on all but the smoothest roads, the cabin is seriously dated and feels cheap, the rear seats are cramped, and the boot is only just above average. Hard to recommend.

Sadly, we suspect the vast majority of NSXs will end up lying dormant under dust covers as inflation-proof investments. That’s nothing short of a criminal act in our eyes, because along with all the technical wizardry and phenomenal performance on offer, the NSX is one of the most engaging and usable everyday supercars you can buy. It’s as comfortable, quiet and as easy to drive and park as your mum’s Civic, but inhale deeply and crank the drive mode selector to Sport+, and the combination of 545bhp and four-wheel-drive traction hurls you at the horizon at insane rates, and fires you through bends quicker than a fibre optic pulse. Do we like it? Just a bit.

For buyers with a sense of style and individuality, and a desperate desire to be different, the DS 5 will undoubtedly strike a chord.

The Kia Niro Hybrid represents a serious eco-conscious alternative to the market leading Toyota Prius and, in some respects, it’s a better car. For a start, it marries the low running costs of a petrol-electric car with a proper twin-clutch automatic gearbox, rather than the dumb-witted CVT that Prius owners are saddled with. However, the Niro isn’t as efficient or as spacious as the Toyota, and its cabin quality is below par. For similar money, the Hyundai Ioniq offers the same hybrid tech and equipment with considerably better quality. ,

Arguably, the Stepway’s faux SUV styling and raised ride height gives it a greater measure of desirability than the Sandero hatchback it is based on. You’ll pay a bit more for those looks, and the fact that only the more powerful engines are available, but like all Dacias, the Stepway still offers excellent value for money. Not surprisingly, at this price point, it’s not the greatest thing to drive and it isn’t exactly sumptuous inside. However, it is as spacious as most family-sized hatchbacks, it’s reasonably well equipped, and it is based on proven Renault mechanical components, so what’s not to like?

The MCV in the Logan’s moniker stands for ‘maximum capacity vehicle’, so if you’re inclined to the old adage ‘never mind the quality, feel the width’, then it’s impossible not to be impressed by the Logan’s generous interior space and no nonsense practicality. While the engines are relatively new and pretty frugal too, the cabin quality is a bit on the thin side, the drive is not exactly engaging, and the refinement is pretty underwhelming. As for the boxy estate car styling; well, let’s just say the Logan has all the allure of a 1970s Moskvitch. Who cares though?

Compared with rival Grand Tourers like the Aston Martin DB11 and McLaren 570GT, the Bentley Continental is much more focused. It concentrates on providing the ultimate GT experience, rather than getting too distracted by the pursuit of sportiness, and it’s all the better for it. Few cars can munch through the miles as quickly and as easily as the Bentley, but it’s also thoroughly engaging to drive, hugely pleasurable to sit in, and more practical than most of its rivals.

At its heart, the Bentley Mulsanne is a luxury limousine, but it’s so much more than that. It’s also the ultimate expression of wealth and prosperity, a lesson in craftsmanship and quality, a symbol of a great British institution, not to mention being an exceptional piece of engineering. Yes, it has an if-you-have-to-ask pricetag, but if you can afford to even think about buying one, you won’t so much as bat an eyelid at the cost.

It’s a testament to the work done at Bentley that its new SUV feels not like a departure, but a natural extension of its current range.

Ford has done a cracking job in turning this Indian-built runaround into a very credible budget supermini for the UK.

Despite its age, the Ford Kuga is still one of the better compact SUVs you can buy. Go for one of the ST-Line models and you’ll be amazed at how engaging the Kuga is to drive. Tick the box for one of the punchy diesel engines and you’ll be just as chuffed by the easy flexibility, strong performance and impressive economy. Inside, the Kuga provides just about enough usable space and versatility for most family needs, along with some groovy connectivity and plenty of advanced safety kit. Unfortunately, all this good work is undermined by a rather dowdy interior that looks and feels seriously old-hat compared to many newer rivals.
","The Kuga has been with us since Adam was a lad, but it’s still a huge seller. No surprise then that Ford has added a range of more efficient engines and the latest tech to help the old boy keep pace with flashier models like the Seat Ateca and Nissan Qashqai."

Take our advice and ignore the slightly tarnished taxi airport run image, because the Ford Galaxy is one of the best full-sized seven-seat MPVs money can buy. Although it’s a big old bus, it never feels like it from behind the wheel. Even when it’s fully laden, it always feels controlled and seldom feels underpowered, thanks to its strong range of diesel engines. Inside, the Galaxy offers everything a growing family could desire, including loads of space, superb all-round visibility, smartly trimmed upholstery, great versatility and oodles of storage solutions.

Crammed with everything that Ford’s engineers have learned, this latest model may be bigger, more comfortable and more refined than ever, but it’s still very much a Fiesta at heart. Consequently, along with its new-found comfort and refinement, it bristles with the type of fun-to-drive character that has beguiled countless Fiesta drivers down the years. As well as that, this latest model is also easier to live with, thanks to more sophisticated ergonomics, upgraded cabin materials and a tad more interior space, along with the latest infotainment technology and safety kit.

The Audi TT RS possesses many traits we’ve become familiar with in the current generation of fast Audis. It looks truly fantastic – all sharp angles and wide aggressive stance – it’s devastatingly quick, beautifully made inside, and has a characterful, monstrous five-cylinder engine. However, it’s also hobbled by the same flaws, with overly light steering and neutral handling that prevent it from knocking the Porsche Cayman off its perch as the best pound-for-pound sports car.

The 2 Series Coupe is a bit of a mixed bag. It delivers strong performance, great efficiency and has a fantastic infotainment system. However, it’s expensive, the driving position is not great, the steering is vague, and it’s not the most refined Coupe we’ve ever driven – especially with a diesel engine under the bonnet. What’s more, the ride is very firm on most models, so if you place a high premium on comfort, you’ll probably be better off looking at an Audi TT or a Volkswagen Scirocco.

When it comes to looking and sounding great, the TT RS Roadster is right on the money. Edgy, sun-seeker looks, a pair of booming exhausts and a beautifully crafted interior are guaranteed to attract gob-smacked gawps, even from the most cynical bystander. It’s not ‘all mouth and no trousers’, either, as its monstrously powerful five-cylinder turbocharged engine delivers a devastating turn of speed. Trouble is, it’s actually too powerful for its own good. With softly tuned suspension intended to minimise the dreaded body shakes, you’ll quickly arrive at a point when the chassis simply can’t cope with the levels of performance on offer. Porsche Boxster, anyone?
","The RS Roadster sits loud and proud at the top of the Audi TT range, providing ballistic performance, a bombastic exhaust note and wind-in-the hair thrills. However, you’d best look elsewhere if you’re the shy, retiring type. "

You only need to drive the A5 Cabriolet 100 metres to realise Audi has thrown everything it knows at its latest four-seat convertible. While the intense levels of body shake that blighted the previous A5 Cabriolet have been reduced exponentially – thanks in no small part to a body that is a whopping 40% stiffer – the line-up is complemented by a range of powerful, efficient and remarkably refined engines. And the cabin is a near-perfect execution of precision and quality, something we’ve almost come to take for granted from Audi these days, with the latest advances in acoustic roof insulation ensuring longer journeys can be enjoyed almost as much as boulevard cruises. Put simply, if you’re in the market for an upmarket, four-seat sun-seeker, they don’t come any more refined or composed than the A5 Cabriolet.

The Pulsar isn’t a car that’s going to get your heart racing – to look at, to sit in or to drive – but it’s a decent all-rounder that majors on practicality and affordability.

Most roadsters are more about posing than driving, but the 718 Boxster is a consummate sports car. The latest model combines brilliant handling balance, immense grip and turbocharged performance that is easier to access during everyday driving. It looks great inside and out, but Porsche purists will be disappointed by the lack of drama and refinement from the new four-cylinder engines, even though they're cleaner than the old model's. The car is more expensive, too, with a pricey options list, but it still feels really special to drive, which ensures that it remains the number one choice in this class.

The latest Cayman looks a million dollars and sets the handling benchmark in this class by a country mile. What’s more, its sublime steering, superb control weights and exceptional ride quality make it a brilliant long-distance GT. The driving position is absolutely spot-on, while the cabin oozes style, quality and ergonomic excellence. Sadly, however, these fine attributes are undermined by a pair of four-cylinder engines that sound and feel disappointingly dull and harsh in an exclusive sports car.

When it comes to performance cars, Porsche knows its stuff, and this revised sixth generation ‘991’ Porsche 911 remains the benchmark for both car makers and customers. It loses very, very little in the transformation from Coupe to Convertible, meaning the Cabriolet is one of the very finest cars of its type.

The Panamera does an excellent job of treading the line between comfort, luxury and performance. Although not as soft and wafty as an S-Class, it’s roomy and supple enough to whisk VIPs around in the back without complaint. But it’s also steeped in Porsche DNA, which makes it fun and engaging to drive when the road opens up.  
","The Panamera is a car that brings Porsche’s strong sportscar heritage into the luxury saloon market.

Time and technology have both moved on a lot since the GT-R first arrived, but the driving experience remains as shocking, brutal and exciting as ever.

The Navara brings previously unimagined comfort and sophistication to the pick-up class. It delivers all the attitude and muscular strength you’d expect of a roughtie-toughtie truck and enlists quite a bit of its SUV cousin’s luxury kit. Although it can still be a bit of a handful in an urban environment, it’s clearly the best top-end pick-up truck you can buy. ,

It scarcely seems believable the GT-R has been around since 2007. Due to being so ahead of its time in terms of performance and technology, over the years it’s required little more than gradual power upgrades, subtle chassis tweaks and upgraded interior treatments to keep pace with newer opposition. The driving experience remains as intoxicating as ever, with incredible straight-line speed and immense cornering grip, ensuring the GT-R holds its own against all but the most exotic supercars. It’s still worthy of a place in anyone’s fantasy garage.

Although Nissan is at pains to point out the latest Micra was designed in-house, you don’t have to look too hard to spot a subtle touch of Gallic flair. As well as sharing stylistic influences, the Micra also uses many of the same mechanical components found in alliance partner Renault’s Clio models. We’re not averse to this spot of plagiarism: the Micra has swish looks, smacks of quality inside and out, is well specified, and is pleasingly light and easy to drive.

The Mazda MX-5 RF delivers all the thrills of the regular MX-5, but with a bit more style. What’s more, the Targa-like roof arrangement doesn’t mean you lose a lot in the way of open-air thrills. It doesn’t really deliver on the promise of greater high-speed refinement, due to an irritating amount of wind-noise, even at moderate speeds, but it’s still a very appealing car in a number of other areas.

If your head says you need a sensible, efficient and refined family car, but your heart wants something fun to drive that’ll turn a few heads, the Mazda 3 is an excellent choice. Most of the niggles we had with the old car have been put right, and only its slightly high list prices, and relatively small boot count against it. The 2.2-litre engine is a great performer, too.

Small saloon cars are a bit of a rarity these days because buyers have always favoured the humble hatchback. However, if you’re swayable, the Mazda 3 Fastback is a very appealing little car. It looks great – maybe even better than the 3 Hatchback – and it’s fun to drive, high in quality, well equipped and affordable to run.

There’s an awful lot to like about the CX-5. Its fresh, modern styling, spacious, versatile interior, slick driving manners and excellent build quality combine to make it feel and drive like a solid, dependable family-friendly SUV. We’d strongly advise against the weedy petrol engine, and think it’s worth finding the significant chunk of extra cash to buy the most powerful diesel-engined version. As well as giving the CX-5 the performance it deserves, this engine makes for a more relaxing drive in everyday circumstances and is infinitely more refined than the other engines. ,

The Mini John Cooper Works is a hot hatch that can thrill with its raw pace and its barnstorming handling in equal measure. It’s expensive to buy, especially if you’re not careful with the options list, and there are lots of other hot hatches available that are cheaper, more practical and better equipped.

The 208 has its plus points, especially the way it looks and the quality feel of the interior. However, it's way too compromised in too many other areas to trouble the class-leaders. If you're not totally sold on the 208's styling, we'd advise you to look elsewhere.,

The latest Countryman provides all the style and image that fans of the Mini brand could want, and that alone will make it appeal to many buyers looking for a fashion-conscious family car.

Both in terms of the way it looks and how it drives, the Quattroporte is a thoroughly distinctive executive saloon.

The Peugeot 308 may not be the best car to drive in its class, but it still has plenty to offer, including impressive performance from the GTi model, plus super refinement and exceptionally low running costs from the latest diesel engine. Try before you buy would be our advice, however, because Peugeot’s rather unique take on ergonomics means the driving position won’t suit all; and, for this kind of money, there are some truly stunning alternatives, including the Volkswagen Golf and Vauxhall Astra.

The 5008 is a flexible SUV with a premium feel that drives well and includes plenty of equipment for your money. Unlike many of its rivals, all variants have seven seats as standard, although space for adults in the second and third rows is limited. It’s not for those that need off-road capability, as there’s no four-wheel drive option, but on the road, it’s impressively capable and comes with a choice of good petrol and diesel engines.

The E-Class Estate has gone from being a one-trick pony with a huge boot, to a polished all-rounder that tops the class in several key areas. If you want an efficient, refined and cavernous estate car that’ll cope with almost every family eventuality, the E-Class is a great choice. It’s not cheap, and the options quickly stack up if you let them, but it comes well equipped, and eases the stress of travel like no other large estate we can think of. Highly recommended.
","The E-Class Estate has always been first choice if you want the biggest boot in the class. We test the new one to see if it’s still number one for practicality, and see if it can match the impressive performance of the saloon version."

The Mercedes GLA is an entirely decent car, but its big problem is that it exists in a class of really very good ones. Both the Audi Q3 and BMW X1 are better to drive than the Mercedes, in terms of both comfort and fun, and the GLA also trails the best for practicality, ergonomics and affordability. There’s no real reason not to buy it, but at the same time, there’s more reason to buy one of its competitors.
","As a compact SUV with a prestige badge, the Mercedes GLA is a head-on rival for cars like the Audi Q3 and BMW X1. It’ll appeal to buyers thanks to its generous equipment and classy interior, but it’ll be those off-roader looks that really tickle the fancy of most buyers."

The Mercedes-Benz E-Class Coupe is a stylish and well-equipped coupe that nails both comfort and quality. If you’re expecting a sporty experience from this coupe, you might be disappointed, but as a luxury cruiser, it’s fabulous. Compared with other coupes, it’s impressively practical in terms of rear seat and boot space, and it’s considerably cheaper than a BMW 6 Series.
","The E-Class Coupe takes the essence of Mercedes’ mid-size saloon, ditches two doors and creates a coupe with more of a smooth and stylish look. It targets the likes of BMW’s 6 Series but at a lower price; one that puts it close to Audi’s smaller A5."

Four-seat prestige convertibles come in all different shapes and sizes, and although the E-Class doesn’t have very many direct competitors, we still reckon it’s one of the better options. It looks fabulous inside and out, it’s comfortable, luxurious and refined to drive and, although it’s not cheap, it feels like good value for money. A very compelling package that’s easy to recommend.

It may not be as engaging to drive as some of its competitors, but the Lexus GS is attractively priced, beautifully built, exceptionally refined and particularly well-equipped. What’s more, because it is powered by a petrol-hybrid powertrain, which produces relatively low CO2 emissions, it’s also a very attractive proposition for company car drivers.

The Lexus RC F is an undeniably interesting car. It looks like nothing else on the road, it goes like stink and it sounds absolutely amazing. Granted, it’s not as dynamically polished as its main rival from BMW, it’s expensive to buy and run, and there are some fairly fundamental ergonomic issues inside the cabin. However, it’s a likeable and enjoyable car nonetheless, and we wouldn’t blame you if you fell in love with the looks alone.

Bold looks, a beautifully finished cabin and hushed hybrid powertrain all count in the RX's favour. Incredibly high equipment levels, strong resale values and low CO2 emissions will make it popular with company car drivers. However, its mild-hybrid powertrain is showing its age. What's more, the large battery limits boot space, the RX has much less grip than other SUVs, and in reality, the fuel economy is average at best, especially on longer journeys.

The 570GT may not be a grand tourer in the traditional sense, but it offers as broad a performance spectrum as we have seen from McLaren.

The RAV4 has been transformed from farm runabout to city slicker – but it remains a rational purchase rather than an emotional one, despite the sharper looks. It is capable to drive, and has a hushed hybrid drivetrain, as well as a spacious interior and boot, but several rivals boast all those abilities, while also being better to drive and much nicer to sit in. It’s also a bit of a shame that the hybrid is so expensive when compared to the rest of the range, as it puts the RAV4 in the crosshairs of some serious premium competitors.,

The Ssangyong Turismo is a big car for not much money, but don’t be fooled. The seating arrangement isn’t clever enough, so it’s not actually all that practical.

The Land Cruiser is a 4x4 for customers who value reliability, practicality and off-road ability above all else. It feels like a dependable tool rather than a lifestyle accessory, but high-end versions are also very well-equipped – if relatively expensive – more modern rivals are streets ahead in terms of refinement and dynamic finesse, not to mention running costs, but for the minority of buyers who really do want to use their SUVs in extreme conditions, it’s as good as ever.

The Prius Plug-in is undoubtedly an urban environment friendly motor thanks to its considerable EV performance. It’s also more tax efficient than the standard Prius, as well as being more refined and comfortable. That said, if your prime concern is social responsibility, the standard car will go a long way to meeting those needs. It also costs considerably less to buy than the Plug-in, and provides superior versatility and practicality.

The Prius is an intriguing alternative to diesel-engined family cars, being well built, comfortable, spacious and extremely tax-efficient. It’s also imaginatively styled inside and out, comes with loads of safety kit and, despite some cheap-looking plastics, feels like it is built to last forever and a day. Trouble is, It is a wee bit joyless to drive and lacks the driving precision and engagement of many of its European diesel-powered rivals. What's more, the petrol-electric hybrid powertrain requires a pedant’s right foot to to get the very best fuel economy and, if you decide to push on a bit, the petrol engine becomes noisy and quite thrashy.

It’s also available with a surprisingly punchy 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine, as well as Toyota’s tried and trusted hybrid powertrain, so it’ll surely appeal to anyone who's worried by the latest negative reports about diesel-engined models. Choose the right model and it’s not expensive to buy or run, either, and it comes with plenty of standard equipment and loads of active safety kit.

","The Seat Ibiza is a stylish alternative to the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa and Renault Clio, with a range of efficient small petrol engines, and technology from the larger Leon."

By just about every tangible measure, the Suzuki Jimny is a very poor car when compared with its rivals. It’s awful on the road, the quality is poor, it’s not very practical, it’s noisy and uncomfortable, it has barely any equipment and, although it’s cheap to buy, other rivals are even cheaper. It’s very impressive off-road and it’s extremely reliable, and as a result, the car has carved out a very loyal cult following. If you’re not one of the hardcore few, though, pretty much any other small SUV will suit you better.

The Renault Megane Sport Tourer is a compact estate car that majors on style and equipment, and provides plenty of both for an affordable price. Running costs are affordable as well.

Set against a backdrop of SUVs that deliver all the comforts, refinement and easy driveability expected of a modern family car, the Forester is always going to struggle. The latest models may be spacious and comfortable enough, but the powertrains are not particularly refined, and the cabin finish is still too basic to appeal to an increasingly sophisticated audience.

The Skoda Kodiaq is a rare beast. It’s a big SUV with a premium image, space for seven, loads of equipment, and a high-quality interior, but a low price. Families will be well catered for by its roomy and practical cabin, and handy little features to make journeys easier, but drivers will not be disappointed either, with tidy handling and a strong engine line-up. The most aggressively priced models do not offer the same standard of kit as the mid-range versions (or seven seats), but it still represents great value motoring, and undercuts anything else like it by miles.,

The Rapid Spaceback is a classic example of Skoda’s philosophy, ‘Simply Clever’. Offering loads of car for your money, it’s priced on par with most superminis, yet offers roughly similar levels of space to cars from the class above. It’s also a reasonably capable car in most areas. Pleasant enough to drive, thanks to nimble handling and nippy performance from its three-cylinder petrol engine, it’s a decent all round proposition, even if it is ultimately let down by an agitated ride and rudimentary interior quality.

There are lots of excellent city cars on offer these days, but for our money, the Skoda Citigo is one of the best.

The Insignia Sports Tourer falls a long way short of its best family estate rivals in a number of areas. Most importantly, it’s not as practical due to its narrow boot and more limited cabin space; but, it also can’t live with the best for refinement, ride comfort or interior quality. However, it does provide handsome-looking transport and low running costs for company car drivers, and that will be good enough for a lot of people. If you’re one of those people, there’s no harm giving it a look, but be sure to try a Ford Mondeo Estate and Volkswagen Passat Estate as well.

The V90 is another example of Volvo – very successfully – not doing what the competition are doing. With its elegant good looks, a distinctive interior and a refined and comfortable driving manners, the big Volvo offers something different to its predominantly German rivals. Throw in its competitive pricing, excellent safety features and fine standard equipment, and it’s a car to which anyone in the market for a prestige estate should give serious consideration.

The latest XC60 retains some Swedish idiosyncrasies, especially in terms of the way it rides, but it’s right up there with the very best when it comes to design sophistication, refinement and interior quality. It’s a very easy vehicle to live with, thanks to its relaxed driving manners, elegant, comfortable interior, and strong, refined diesel engines. It’s not cheap, but even the entry model cars come with plenty of kit, including four-wheel-drive, an eight-speed gearbox, a powered boot lid, and an extensive list of safety kit. Add to this spacious, airy accommodation, a useful sized boot, and affordable running costs, and it’s clear, the XC is worthy of serious consideration.

The Golf R is a very accomplished car indeed, and arguably the best all-rounder in the hot-hatch class.

The Golf is the car that defines Volkswagen, and delivers on every front. The Golf’s myriad attributes guarantee huge desirability, strong sales and stellar residual values. It remains the best car in its class, by a country mile.
","The Volkswagen Golf is Europe’s best-selling family hatchback, which says an awful lot when you consider it’s up against some phenomenal opposition, including the Vauxhall Astra, Ford Focus and BMW 1 Series."

www.autotrader.co.uk,Volkswagen',Phill Tromans,Volkswagen Beetle hatchback (2016 - ) review,First published: 17th March 2017,3.1,"Funky looks and image,Some strong engine options,Charming cabin","Only room for two in the back,Uninspiring to drive,Not particularly cheap",,"
Taken on purely tangible merits, the Beetle is competent but unremarkable, especially when compared with some of the other talented cars in the family hatchback class. But even so, it has undeniable appeal thanks to its cutesy, retro design, with plenty of clever references to Beetles of old, both inside and out. It’s decent - if uninspiring – to drive, but the Mini Hatch is much more involving on the road and a better overall offering.
","Volkswagen hangs the Beetle firmly on the hook of the car’s illustrious heritage, and the latest incarnation is full of historic references. Much like the Mini and the Fiat 500, this three-door hatchback is a retro, kitsch alternative to more staid rivals."
www.autotrader.co.uk,Volkswagen',Pete Tullin,Volkswagen Golf Estate (2017 - ) review,First published: 3rd May 2017,3.8,"Large and convenient luggage area,Impressive engine line-up,Excellent interior quality","A good deal more expensive than the excellent Skoda Octavia Estate,Sub-120bhp versions get a more basic suspension set-up,It’ll have limited appeal when you come to sell it",,"
It’s always been a bit of a mystery as to why the Golf Estate hasn’t sold in greater numbers. Maybe it’s because it’s not thought to be worth the premium Volkswagen asks over its hatchback sibling. Possibly it’s because small estate cars retain something of a commercial image about them, or maybe it’s simply a case of if you need a proper load-lugger, you’d be better off with Volkswagen’s larger Passat wagon. Regardless, the Volkswagen Golf Estate is still a class act, thanks to its beautifully built interior, superb powertrains, sweet driving characteristics and excellent versatility. Just don’t expect it to be as desirable with used buyers, or retain its value as well as its hatchback brethren when you come to sell it.,
","The Volkswagen Golf Estate may not enjoy the same level of sales success as its hatchback sibling, but that doesn’t make it any less of a beautifully built, excellent driving and immensely practical estate car. "

The Viva isn’t quite the best car in its class, but the mix of smart looks, fine standard equipment and good-value pricing makes a very compelling case for the car. If you’re in the market for a city car, it’s certainly worth a look. But, before you sign up, do take a test drive to make sure you can live with the ride, and that the engine is strong enough for your daily duties.  
","The Viva sits below the Corsa in Vauxhall's line-up, giving the company a rival for city cars like the Hyundai i10 and Volkswagen Up"

It’s been a long time since the Vauxhall Astra mounted a realistic challenge to the leaders in the small family hatchback class, but this latest version has a shout. It’s good to drive, well equipped, competitive on practicality, and affordable to buy and run.
","The Vauxhall Astra is one of the mainstays of the small family hatchback class, and sells in huge numbers as a result. And, this latest Astra might just have what it takes to compete with the Ford Focus and Volkswagen Golf."

The Vauxhall Astra Sports Tourer is a real contender in the world of small estate cars. It’s good to drive, well equipped, strong on practicality and affordable to buy and run; in other words, it's everything that a good estate car should be.
