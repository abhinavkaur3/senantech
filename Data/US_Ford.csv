Hi Ford, my new car has been on a ramp for 2 months in a ford dealership in Ireland because they can't get a flywheel for it.  It's a brand new car (Ford Custom Tourneo Limited) With ongoing problems since purchase. No one from Ford Ireland has ever contacted us in person.  We have now been told the part is expected on the 28 of this month.  We have no faith it will arrive as the date keeps moving.  Our insurance will not cover us after the 28th. Is their anything Ford Motor Company  can do.  We have the car adapted and it houses a wheelchair and stability dog.
At this point we should just be given a new car if ours cant be fixed.  Regards Denis, Dublin, Irl."

 Dear friend Gregorio. The Ford test at Latin NCAP is almost 4 years old. I´d rather go with Honda HRV for that matter, as tests were made in 2015 and seem quite better (Here we came accross the discussed problem addressed by Globan NCap about different markets and different approaches by the same brands regarding safety) . Ford also have been struggling with the Powershift transmission with all models, too (not only the Brazilian made models). The 2018 Ecosport seems to be skipping this automatized transmission system though, possibly for those reasons."

 Idea for Ford Driverless
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Cryptocurrency mined out of Driverless Connected Car Ecosystem, framework On Blockchain platform  as Proof Of Work or POW or Proof Of Stake or POS
++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
Details: 
I have already posted on my linkedin profile. 
Idea: 
Cryptocurrency mining out of driverless connecred cars eco system based on blockchain technology. i.e generating  or mining a new crypto coin Coin called as ""Vahan"" word is mother of latin word ""Vehiculum"" . Any other name too possible. 
How it will be produced ? 
This currency will be rewarded to miner for carrying outresearch, development  work, activities, innovations, securing network for this ""Vahan"" coin transactions as Proof of Work POW or Proof of Stake or POS. I dont have infrastructure, manpower to do all this reasearch so I am requesting Oracle, Google, IBM , SAP, Microsoft, Tata Motors, Tesla, Suzuki, Ford, Toyota , Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto, Mr. Vitalik, all crypto currencyinnovators, global IT giants  to help  me achiving this objective. 
This curency value will grow as things moves ahead on blockchain driverless connected car world. This new cryptocurrency will be exchangable in all global virtual  currency exchnges like Localbitcoins.

 Last Wednesday evening 23rd June, on the hottest day of the year, Ford Roadside assistance left a confused and vulnerable 77 year old woman high and dry stranded in my country village in Bucks.  She was forced to stay in my house from 20:00 until 22:45 when I put her in a taxi home because the guaranteed response time magically increased from 22:30 to 00:30 and I needed to go to bed.    Naturally once I had paid £60 of my own cash on her taxi, Ford online Customer Service washed their hands of the situation and passed the buck to the lady's local Ford dealer.  It's not my job to contact the dealer, it's Ford's job to ask their dealer to contact me.  On that basis I'll pursue my money through the online small claim court and Ford can pay the admin fee.  I have a civic duty of care and Ford need to recognise that.  Apart from the obvious reputational damage Ford don't seem to understand that if the lady had broken down 300 yards further down the road in 30 degree heat, they would almost certainly now be looking at a corporate manslaughter charge because they had no prioritisation in place.  Negligent on every level.  I won't ever be buying a Ford again......"

 I have read the article and the only thing guaranteed green is the colour BEVs  mainly plug into the Grid and that normally has about 50% Fossil Fuels, okay to transfer emissions to a power station when the numbers are small, however when there are millions of BEVs  that will still be substantial tonnes of CO2.

Of course that is if the grid has generating capacity to meet that demand.

What Ford ought to take a look at is my concept for a Hydrogen Rotary Engine-generator designed to power EVs.  This small car is limited to 100 miles with HyPulJet.2.0 power the range would be exceptional with On Demand Fuel production on board the EV.

Ford need to consider this before GM take a look because HyPulJet.2.0 will be a simple fit into a Chevvy Volt = Zero CO2  Zero NOx  Zero Particulate Matter.  In the UK the Volt is traded as the Ampera and there are two H2 Fuel Cell EVs at over £50,000  a Zero Emissions H2 Ampera would be £20,000 less than the FCEVs

HyPulJet.2.0 is up for grabs.

 we need quality from ford the cars they produce now are a cheap imitation of the ones that I grew up with too much technology and very poor basic design the ""award winning ""1.0l ecoboost engine is a perfect example of short sited design a poorly constructed split cooling system and cylinder head leading to the early failure of the engine with the head actually melting under the very high operating temperature the engine is designed as a throw away unit and replacement costs currently running at around £5000  mark with the bare engine costing an astounding £3800 my personal 30 year relationship with Ford is now over I will never buy another product from them

 Ford's door latch issues are truly annoying.  Say, for example the EcoSport tailgate lock which placed its brand in jeopardy.  In just 2 years or 60,000km use, the door latch of EcoSport was in trouble.  If not for the vehicle's warranty coverage, it would have been a total mess.  Sacrificing the quality of your car to pave way for a slight feature innovation is a wrong move.  Imagine driving  your car a few kilometers with a damaged tailgate door lock to a nearest Ford Service center?  You'll need a DIY thing to hold the car's rear door tied from the inside.  Better utilize standard door locks which gets damaged above 5 years, sometimes 10 years.  "

 Hey I think it's great idea, propose it for developping countries, off road etc. Countries surrounding arid areas (Sahara, Atacama, Death Valley, Arizona) could be neatly interested. Ambulances, frontier police, military. 
Also, for a powertrain engineer, I'm surprised to see that he hasn't come up with turning that water into steam and injecting it to the engine, boosting efficiency up to 20% on big V8 engines while at the same reducing emissions, boosting engine lifespread ( as you can monitor this produced steam ).

This is regarding my car Eco Sports,  as i newly purchased Eco sports, and Unfortunately I met with an accident on dated 21st January 2017, So I left it on dated 23rd January 2017 at Delhi Ford body Shop for repair it. 
But I am very sorry to say that I am very upset due to its more than 2 month (60 days) & my car is still not repaired due to require parts are not available at body shop as week as with FORF too, As Body Shop Manger confirmed, that Ford is not dispatching  the parts while he has requested to dispatch the same many times to Ford Chennai.
I have already mailed to Form customer care many times but not satisfactory results. 

So request you guys, please forwards this massage to your all friends.. so that they can take correct decision in case of they are thinking to buy car

 Very poor car maker.
I have an automatic Ecosport 2015 that is a 60 day stop at the dealership with factory warranty waiting for exchange exchange and they say they are at fault and have no exchange forecast.
If a car is currently being produced they have no part to provide you imagine having a little older car. You have to pray for no maintenance.

 Did you know the pedestrians can have greater visibility prior to walking into the street by seeing my newest invention to allows view of the HIGH MOUNT SIDE DOOR DIRECTIONAL?  Did you also know that a cyclist in the city can now see a partially opened vehicle door at night over one thousand feet away prior to the vehicle door fully opened into the path of his bicycle ?  And the list goes on and on. 
It is time Ford Motor Company came up to my standards to allow people in Cities to get around more safety with my VEHICLE DOOR ACCIDENT AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS. 
What a clever idea, SEEING.

 Excellent!  We all need to look for ways to engage girls (and boys) at a younger age to share our excitement about engineering and science.  Many are not choosing careers in engineering and science related fields simply because they have not been exposed to them and do not recognize how exciting they can be.  "

 Ford has changed my life for the worst I will never invest my money into one of there new release vehicles again i purchased a 2016 Focus RS and now the 2017 focus RS is being built and is selling in many showrooms.But I'm told there are no spare parts available for the 2016 yet the 2017 is exactly the same 
I picked my car up June 18th 2016 and on 11th October 2016 I got cut off and ended up damaging the hub.My car went to Ford on October 12th 2016 and the dealership has now had it in there possession longer than I've had it in mine yet every 2 weeks I still have to make full payments for a car I don't have I just think it's dreadful how they can make the 2017 yet say there's no parts for the 2016 just ship me a hub from the factory it's not like it's going to halt production

 Speaking from experience.. this article is on point!!  I have been out of work, for a few months now, I feel the ebb and flow of this process. Some days are great, and you feel like this is the day!! Then there are stretches where you have little response to anything you do.  I know that in those times, I will do my greatest work in finding my next great adventure . I am still unemployed as of today, but with the right people looking to hire, I am hopeful that soon I will be part of a new team of like minded people!! Good luck to all looking for work

The casinos in greektown were an experience as compared to AC...  A dinner cruise up the river with Canada on one side, and  Detroit on the other, the red Wings game... Saw the octupus on the ice... Very intersting tradition there... Can not wait to go back.."

 I am currently working at Airbus Ds Optronics ,  which is a boarder security company based in Centurion. And I am also currently completing my B-tech in Industrial engineering, I would like to consider myself  as an individual with passion to learn new things through working hard and seeking of relevant knowledge to answer questions of things I don’t know yet. It is of my great interest to acquire and develop skills necessarily needed in Industrial Engineering, so that at the end of the day I may be able to design, develop, test and evaluate integrated systems for managing industrial production processes including human work factors ,quality control, logistics and material flow, cost analysis and production coordination. I also like challenges therefore I believe I am ready to withstand any challenges that I will encounter while working for you, and as well ready to carry out any task that I will be given in Industrial Engineering to uplift my skills.

Furthermore as a diligent and hardworking individual who also takes pride in my own work, I would like to gain valuable skills and experience with regard to application of what I have learnt during my theory years in real life problems.

Please help me join the organisations

 as I've been aware of autism for 32 years , I have seen a great number of entities taking advantage of them , to my disbelief I also see a corporate advantage being taken .......my sister has Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy and Autism from the DTP shot from Eli Lilly , so I am very aware of all the paradigm , I was there when she got the shot and I held her for her first 15 minute long Grand Mal seizure at 6 months old , I was 14 . Hardest thing I've ever done in my life . So please understand my severe skepticism of this protocol , for it is corporate greed that makes children autistic , and the forcing of mandates on chemical poisoning a.k.a vaccines is criminal in that it creates the paradigm of Autism ....which is an encephalopathy injury in the brain , and is curable thru GcMAF treatment . Don't normalize it , cure it !"

 David, I disagree with you. There are no federal laws protecting LGBT people in the workforce like there are to protect other groups of people. That means that they can be fired at any time just for who they are.  It is important for LGBT job seekers to know what companies are a safe place to work so they don't have to worry about harassment and discrimination, or fear losing their job for no legitimate reason. Nothing can be taken for granted when it comes to equal rights."

 This is what's wrong with America !!! This is why an average working woman or man can't buy a new car or truck. Why the hell is there a chief diversity officer or diversity officer or a diversity department!! Wake up America. The hardest working most qualified man or woman should get the job. Done that's it. Quit babing people. Get off your ass America tighten your belts and lets kick ASS.

 Joseph, you are completely missing the point. This has nothing to do with job qualifications or hiring quotas, if that's what you think. It's about LGBT people having equal rights in the workplace and having a safe, welcoming place to work without discrimination.  If you don't agree with it, that's your privilege. But LinkedIn is not the place for this kind of rhetoric. This is a professional site and your opinions are better suited for an environment such as Facebook.

 How do they even measure this to know (statistics - data science)?  I never knew people were telling HR their sexual preferences to document this?  When people quit or get fired is it part of exit interview to ask your sexual preference?  Seems rather baseless claim to pull out a specific group like this ... the idea of treating everyone the same is not to call them out as separate group.  Everyone should be treated the same regardless of race, sex, beliefs, politics, etc. and measured on their abilities to do the job.  We need to stop putting labels on people and stop drawing attention to differences and come together as one team that has a job to do.

 Actually, what this graphic states is that this company achieved 100% on the HRC Corporate Equality Index for 2017, which has nothing to do with asking someone about their sexual orientation or gender identity, but more to do with things like inclusive healthcare, etc.       http://www.hrc.org/campaigns/corporate-equality-index

 Phil Beyers     ME, IE, MBA, EIT, CSSBB
      
 Jessica Allen  It says ""for LGBT"" , which now is going to cause every other group to say, but what about my group ""for minorities"", ""for ______""  ; leaving the ""for"" off greatly improves the badge.  Or maybe others are thinking , hmmm, why did they write it like that, does that mean my group did not get 100%....  I call this a marketing Fopa

 It is a shame for a perfectly good candidate to be rejected from a career position because of the sex/gender of the person they choose to love.

In the mental health field, I had a hard time being discriminated against, at a facility I got an interview at, for having a disability earlier this year.

A different time,I had a card given to me about my religion because I wrote a poem on LGBT earlier this year for a mental health event. I was surprised because, as a spiritual and religious person myself, it was my first time being bible thumped to that extent.

It's hard when you try to be open about yourself, because people will be rejected for being LGBTSQ, a lot of time because of fear and ignorance. It leads to a lot of issues like Pure OCD, suicidal behavior, eating disorders, for one of the most bullied populations in our country.

What bothers me in my revelation today is that the very people I want to work with (teenagers with depression), will have a really hard time being sure of themselves or trusting anyone, if a country that is lucky enough to be educated for free, can't educate themselves enough on how to be a decent human being.

 Just apply for the job without having to qualify yourself by including your LGBT lifestyle. If your good at what you do then the other crap shouldn't even come into play. Keep your personal issues private when applying for a position and let your abilities carry the day. It's really a no brainer.

By the way ""Driving Tips"" begin, start and end in having the vehicle driver SEE.  Find out from me what all drivers do not see, that I allowed all of them to see.

It is now reasonable to say that the European model of private personal transportation is taking place which is park the vehicle outside the city and take public transit to your destination.  Yes the fun and games of having a parking app can be possibly useful in knowing in advance if a parking garage is full or if an entire city has no parking available.  The reality is either make vehicles half the length they current are to allow for not one but three vehicles in the same space.

 This is mostly good advice, but I agree with Andy Harmon: #8 and #30 could get you into more trouble (leaving off short-term jobs and travel) than simply telling the truth. 

I am also very concerned about # 20 ... telling people to dump everything prior to 15 years. If you’re skipping a couple of years, that’s no big deal. However, if you throw out 20 years of experience, then walk in to an interview with a person who's expecting a 35-year old, what will happen? Shock. Confusion, and a very awkward start to the interview! You might think “See? I knew they were gonna discriminate against me because I’m older!” when in fact they are just trying to figure out if they showed up for the wrong interview. 

I know why you want to throw out half of your wonderful career experience. I really do. If you still want to do that, by all means do so … just not on your resume. Do it on your LinkedIn profile, or create something other than a resume. I often help people create a 5' x 7' “snapshot” with key skills and accomplishments. There, it’s perfectly fine to shave off half of who you are. But, on your resume? Tricky. Very tricky. On the hiring side of the desk, it raises all sorts of alarms (“Did he murder someone?"

 I disagree with removing the ""Hobbies"" and ""Taking Time Off"" sections.  As a Recruiter and Hiring Manager who works closely with many Clients, I always ask about employment gaps.  If an applicant can identify them on the resume it is more transparent.  Hobbies can be an ice breaker for a phone or in-person interview.  I have seen many applicants get sales/CSR roles due to their active involvement in gyms, etc.
