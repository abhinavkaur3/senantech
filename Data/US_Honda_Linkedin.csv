,Kindly ponder if distance sensor or proximity sensor could be used in determining a car dent or damage on the car. 
,A distance sensor fixed in four directions of the car with a fixed detection of the range of motion to the peripheral or outer body of the car would determine any change or damage in the outer body upon an accident. 
,Such sensors would give peace of mind to a driver when a car is parked and unsupervised.
,All people matter regardless of sexual preference . We really need to stop segregation by specialization.

,"Just because of the money. One thing is diversity,  which includes  tolerance with who thinks differently, and another is permisivity. "
,"One thing is not to discriminate homosexuals  and another thing is to promote them. Then, to be consistent, they should do it for each minority, but I don't see it. See  what I mean? Just because of the money."
,Kindly ponder if the left and right indicator lever in the car should be moved to the steering wheel for the following reasons: 1. 
,The most common object we touch after steering wheel is indicator lever and it is placed behind the steering wheel. 2. The use of indicator lever requires upward and downward movement of index finger which is against the natural movement of the finger. 3. A touch button indicator on the steering wheel will ensure soft and gentle application of indicator and will ensure both hands on the wheel of the driver. 4. The indicator could be turned off with the turning of the steering wheel or a touch of opposite side of indicator button.

,"You guys need to give Acura some love. Seems like Honda is mor focused on and gets the most modern features, engines, and designs. Growing up it was the opposite. "
,"You had cars like the Integra Type R, first gen TSX with a 6spd option etc.  "
,hopefully one day you can have $35-40k performance coupe or sedan that actually  competes in its class and isn't only a good value

,I am glad to know this result in Honda. I think Acura need the car that have market potential. 
,"Acura displays the NSX in the showroom and attracts many people, but because there is no car that can be purchased affordably, it will not lead to sales. If you do not arrange intermediate grade sports cars to line up, it will be a tremendous glimpse of NSX. "

,Great company! I consulted there for over 7 years on CX/CRM overseeing several strategic initiatives. 
,"Know them well. Always knew they had a significant US manufacturing presence, but, the fact that at least 75% of the Honda and Acura vehicles sold in the U.S. since 2001 were built in North America is strong evidence of their commitment."

,"I just wanted to add a piece of info to """"American Honda Motor Company, Inc."""""
,I just wanted to let you know I waited for your Ridgeline to come out and went down today to lease one. But when I got down there and found out you went to CAPLESS GAS TANKS LIKE FORD & Others I canceled the paperwork because I REFUSE TO BUY OR LEASE A VEHICLE WITH A CAPLESS GAS TANK. I have gone through 37 vehicles and will keep looking till I find one with a Gas Cap or I'll go USED but I refuse to LEASE OR BUY a CAPLESS Fuel System!
,"Hello, I am owner of 2015 CR-V which was made in USA, imported to South Korea, and sold by Honda Korea."
,"As you know, in USA, TSB 16-053 have been implemented since Aug, 2016."
,"However, in South Korea, Honda Korea refused to apply the same campaign to the owner of 2015, 2016 CR-V and Accord."
,"It is such a shame that Honda, as a global company, discriminates customer in other country, like South Korea."
,Please reconsider this policy of discrimination and let customer have the same service of Honda.

,"Since 1990, i've been an active enthusiast of the Honda Motor Co. Brand, and i've spotted a very BIG flaw in many Honda Dealers in Portugal...the lack of knowledge and above all, True PASSION for the Brand itself...as soon as you can solve that problem, your sales will grow exponentially! If only i had a chance..."

,"Respected Sir/Madam,"
,Are you looking for a great technology idea in automobile industry which would:
,1. decrease the road accidents by 90% due to overspeeding.
,2. earn huge profit.
,3. showcase this pioneered innovation by your company.
,4. bring a new standard in automobile industry.
,5. any many more
,"If yes, I am like to showcase my idea and I will be thankful to you for considering my request."
,Hope to hear from you soon!
,Note: I am NOT willing to make money out of this. Just a thought for the world society and road safety.

,"I read somewhere that """"The antithesis of flashy, Honda owners are usually pragmatic and well educated; 70% boast a college degree or higher, compared with 35% of Chevy owners and 45% of Ford owners."""" But I wonder who are buying your CR-V? I'm of the mind that whoever drives a non-commercial car whose height is over 1.5 m in cities is saying I'm a nouveau riche and at the same time, Honda doesn't cater for parvenus. It's a paradox to me."
,Michael Pyers
,"We love our CRV - it gets well over 30 mpg on the highway, sits high so you can see better, and is a lot easier for older people to enter and exit."
,Mohammad Daneshgar
,"Michael Pyers I do know likes of you love their crossovers and grant there's no accounting for taste. Yet I reckon """"taste"""" is about loving to drive Accord, Altima and so on or to drive Lexus ES, GS and LS. But loving to drive crossover or SUV in cities is about your character."
